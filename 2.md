# Chapter 2 Odoo 15 Development Environment Preparation

Before we dive deeper into Odoo development, we need to configure the development environment and learn some basic management tasks.

In this chapter, we will learn how to configure the environment required to build Odoo applications. We will configure an Ubuntu system to host the development server instance. You can use a cloud server, a local server, or a subsystem on Windows 10.

After studying this chapter, readers will know how to prepare a development environment, run Odoo from source code, and have multiple Odoo projects and multiple Odoo versions on the same machine. Readers will also learn how Odoo servers run and how to use them during development.

This article mainly explains the following contents:

- Configure the host for the Odoo server
- Install Odoo from source
- Manage Odoo database
- Configure Odoo server parameters
- Find and install community plugins
- Use server-side development mode

The first step of this chapter is to check whether you meet the technical requirements of this chapter and configure the host to install Odoo later.

## Development Preparation

In this chapter, we will install Odoo from source code on Ubuntu 20.04 operating system. We only need to use the terminal environment, without the Ubuntu graphical user interface.

If you don’t have Ubuntu 20.04, you can also use a Windows 10 host. We can use the Linux subsystem of Windows to get the Ubuntu environment in the Windows system.

The relevant code for this chapter can be found in the **ch02/** directory of the accompanying GitHub repository.

## Set up the Odoo service host

It is recommended to use Debian/Ubuntu to run Odoo services, which is also the reference deployment platform. Odoo's own SaaS platform also runs on Debian, which is also the most popular choice in the community. In other words, it is easier to find help or advice when using Debian or Ubuntu.

> **Note**: You can also choose the Odoo.sh service to develop and run Odoo. It provides a Git-based development workflow and provides all the supplementary services needed to run a production system, such as sending and receiving emails. If readers are interested in this, there is a very comprehensive introduction in the [Odoo official documentation](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/user/15.0/odoo_sh/documentation.html.).

If you already have Ubuntu 20.04, you can start learning. You just need to make sure that you have elevated your privileges to perform the necessary installation steps. Run the following command in the terminal to check. If successful, you can proceed to the following learning:

```
$ sudo apt list
```

If you are using Windows, the simplest solution is to use WSL, which we will explain in the next section.

If this solution is not available to you, you can also use a virtual machine. We won't go into detail, but the following two points will help:

- VirtualBox is a free cross-platform virtualization software, visit <https://www.virtualbox.org>.
- Ubuntu server ISO images can be downloaded from [https://www.ubuntu.com/server](https://www.ubuntu.com/server.). It is recommended to use the latest long-term support (**LTS**) version.

TurnKey Linux provides easy-to-use pre-installed images for several platforms, including ISOs. The ISO format can be used with all virtualization software, even on bare metal. The LAPP image is a good choice, which includes Python and PostgreSQL. It can be found at <http://www.turnkeylinux.org/lapp>.

### Installing Linux using Windows Subsystem

In March 2020, a more robust Linux subsystem (WSL2 - Windows Subsystem for Linux2) has been supported since version 2004 of Windows 10. With the subsystem, we can run Ubuntu in Windows, which is enough to handle everything needed for Odoo development. For more information about WSL2, please refer to the [official website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-index).

WSL is an optional feature in Windows 10 and needs to be enabled before use. For details on how to do this, see the [official help document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

You should then be able to install the Ubuntu Windows app. Open the Windows Store and search for Ubuntu. At the time of writing this book, the latest Ubuntu **LTS** (Long Term Support version) is 20.04. Follow the installation process and set up a user account and the corresponding password.

Running the Ubuntu application will open a Linux command line window where you can enter Ubuntu commands. Write down the username and password you configured when installing Ubuntu, as you will be asked to enter the password information when using **sudo** to extract the files.

Now that we have a working Debian-based operating system, we can start installing Odoo and its dependencies, as well as the PostgreSQL database.

## Install Odoo from source

Odoo uses Python programming language and uses PostgreSQL database for data storage. To run Odoo from source code, we need to install the Python libraries it depends on. Then download the Odoo source code from GitHub. Using Git repository is better than downloading source code ZIP or tar file. Using Git we can control the code version, and it is also a good tool for the release process.

> Note: The specific dependencies to be installed may vary depending on the operating system and the version of Odoo installed. If you encounter problems in the above steps, please refer to the [official documentation](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/15.0/setup/install.html). You can switch versions to view the steps for other versions.

### Install PostgreSQL database

Odoo needs to use the PostgreSQL service. A typical development setup is to install PostgreSQL on the same machine as Odoo.

Run the following command to install the PostgreSQL database in Debian/Ubuntu system:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql -y # 安装PostgreSQL
sudo su -c "createuser -s $USER" postgres # Create a database super user
```

The last command creates a PostgreSQL user for the current system user, which is used when the Odoo instance creates or deletes a database.

If you are running Ubuntu in WSL, please note that system services will not start automatically. This means that you must manually start the PostgreSQL service when running any command that requires a database connection (such as createuser or starting the Odoo service). To manually start the PostgreSQL service, execute the following command:

```
$ sudo service postgresql start
```

### Install Odoo system dependencies

Running Odoo requires some system libraries. Git should be installed to get the source code under version control. Python 3.7 or later is required to install and run Odoo 15. The following are the basic system dependencies required:

```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt upgrade
$ sudo apt install git # Install Git
$ sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip python3-wheel \
python3-venv # Python 3 for development environment
$ sudo apt install build-essential libpq-dev libxslt-dev \
libzip-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev libssl-dev
```

> **Changes in Odoo 12**
>
> The CSS preprocessor has been changed from less to Sass. This means that you no longer need to use less to run Odoo. Odoo versions 9-11 require the use of the less preprocessor.

If you need to use version 11 or earlier, you also need to install less:

```
sudo apt install npm # Install Node.js and package manager
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node # Run Node.js through node
sudo npm install -g less less-plugin-clean-css # 安装less
```

### Install Odoo from source

For ease of management, we will create a /work15 directory in our home directory as a working directory. In this series of articles, we assume that the Odoo code is installed in this directory.

Odoo 15 uses Python 3 (3.6 or later), which means that we do not use python and pip in the command line, but python3 and pip3.

> **Changes in Odoo 11**\
> Starting from version 11, Odoo runs on Python 3. Odoo 11 still supports Python 2.7, but Odoo 12 can only run in Python 3.5+ environment. Odoo 10 and previous versions can only run in Python 2.7.

To install Odoo from source, we first need to clone the Odoo source code directly from GitHub:

```
mkdir ~/work15 # Create a working directory
cd ~/work15 # Enter the working directory
git clone https://github.com/odoo/odoo.git -b 15.0 --depth=1 # Get Odoo source code
```

The ~ symbol is shorthand for the user's home directory, such as /home/alan. If you are using the WSL subsystem of Windows 10, you can find this directory by opening `\wsl$` in the file browser. The full path to the working directory is similar to **`\wsl$\Ubuntu-20.04\home\daniel\work15`. **

The `-b 15.0` in the Git command explicitly states that we want to download the Odoo 15.0 branch. At the time of writing this article, this is somewhat redundant as this is the current default branch, but this may change in the future.

`--depth=1` tells Git to download the most recent revisions instead of all the historical changes, which should make the download faster and less complex.

> **Tip:** If you need to get the content committed after downloading, you can run git fetch --unshallow. You can only get the recent updates. git fetch --depth=100 will download the latest 100 commits, while git fetch --shallow-since=2020-01-01 will get all commits after January 1, 2020.

Next, we should install the Python dependencies declared in requirements.txt. It is recommended to install them in a Python virtual environment. This will protect the Odoo environment from system-wide Python library updates. Another benefit is that you can keep multiple virtual environments depending on the specific projects you need to work on, such as when we use an older Odoo version. Let's get started:

1. Execute the following command to create a new virtual environment:


    ```
    $ python3 -m venv ~/work15/env15
    ```

    This will create a Python environment in the ~/work15/env15 directory.

1. We want to run all Python code using ~/work15/env15/bin/python. The following command will display the installed Python version for confirmation:


    ```
    $ ~/work15/env15/bin/python -V
    Python 3.8.10
    ```

1. If you set it as the current default Python interpreter, it will be easier to use. You can enable the virtual environment with the following command:


    ```
    $ source ~/work15/env15/bin/activate
    ```

Once we enable the virtual environment, the command line will change to include information about the enabled environment. In this case, it will change from `$` to `(env15) $`.

You can run the `which` command to confirm that the correct Python interpreter is being used:

```
(env15) $ which python
/home/alan/work15/env15/bin/python
```

Simply run `deactivate` to deactivate the virtual environment; the Python interpreter will then return to the system default:

```
$ deactivate
$ which python3
/usr/bin/python3
```

Please re-enable the virtual environment before executing the following commands.

After enabling the virtual environment, you can run the following command to install Python dependencies:

```
$ source ~/work15/env15/bin/activate
(env15) $ pip install -U pip # Update pip
(env15) $ pip install -r ~/work15/odoo/requirements.txt
```

> Note: In a virtual environment, the python and pip commands are used directly to point to the correct versions. This is not the case in the default operating system environment, where pip points to Python 2 and pip3 points to Python 3. To run these commands system-wide, replace pip with pip3, as Odoo uses Python 3.

Some Python libraries require system binaries to be installed. If you are unable to install some libraries, make sure you have installed the system dependencies as described in the Installing Odoo System Dependencies section of this chapter.

Now the Python dependencies are installed. But you still need to install Odoo itself. You can use pip to install it:

```
(env15) $ pip install -e ~/work15/odoo
```

The -e option is used to make a Python editable installation. This way the source code files in the ~/work15/odoo directory can be used to run Odoo. Without this option, the installation process will copy the code files in the source directory to the site-packages/ directory and then run these copies, so changes or updates to the source code will not be reflected.

### Run Odoo

To run Odoo you must first enable the corresponding virtual environment:

```
$ source ~/work15/env15/bin/activate
```

Inside the virtual environment, just run Odoo to start the instance:

```
( env15 ) $ odoo -- version
Odoo Server 15.0
```

The odoo command is a handy shortcut that you will use frequently throughout this book. Also, you can start Odoo by calling the corresponding executable command:

```
( env15 ) $ ~/work15/odoo/odoo-bin --version
```

For more complete control, you can run Odoo with a specific Python executable path, without activating the virtual environment:

```
$ ~/work15/env15/bin/python ~/work15/odoo/odoo-bin –-version
```

If you do not add the `--version` option when running Odoo, it will keep running and wait for the client to call it.

The default listening port of Odoo is **8069**. You should use **http://localhost:8069** to access the Odoo service in your browser.

To stop the service and return to the command line, press the shortcut keys *Ctrl* + *C*.

### Create a new database through the web client

When you first access Odoo, since there is no database yet, we will create a new database in the auxiliary page. Under the default configuration, access Odoo through http://localhost:8069::

[![Figure 2.1: Database creation form](https://p3-juejin.byteimg.com/tos-cn-i-k3u1fbpfcp/b27d2a01483e4dbcbab8837fac1c7f5e~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-1.image)](https://i.cdnl.ink/homepage/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022050515531581.jpg)

Figure 2.1: Database creation form

The information required to be filled in the database creation form is as follows:

- The Master Password is the administrative password for the database and is stored in the Odoo configuration file. The latest versions will automatically generate this password, see the picture above.
- Database Name is the name of the database. Multiple Odoo databases can be hosted on the same database server, using separate names.
- **Email** is the default administrator user login username. It does not have to be an email address. The default value is **admin**.
- Password (**Password**) is the password used by the administrator to log in.
- Language (**Language**) is the default language used by the database.
- Country is the country used for default settings. This is optional and is relevant for localization of some apps, such as invoicing and accounting apps.
- The default is an empty database, but if you check the Demo data checkbox, demo data will be installed. It is recommended to check this option for development and testing environments.

> Note:
>
> The administrator (**admin**) password and the master (**master**) password are different concepts. The master password is used to manage the database and can be used to back up, restore, and copy the Odoo database. The administrator password is the default administrator login password, which has the authority to configure the Odoo database and manage users.

After clicking the Create Database button, a new database will be created and initialized, which will take some time. When ready, you will be redirected to the login interface.

You can enter the database management page through the Manage databases button at the bottom of the login page. This management page displays the current database list and allows you to back up, copy or delete it, as well as create a new database.

You can also directly visit http://localhost:8069/web/database/manager to enter the database management page.

> Note:
>
> The database administration page allows some high-privilege administrative operations. It is enabled by default and has no password protection. Although convenient, it is a security threat. Please consider using a complex master password or better yet, turning this feature off. The master password is set in the Odoo configuration file as `admin_passwd = <your-complex-password>`. The database administration page can be disabled by adding `list_db = False` to the configuration file. See the **Configuring Odoo Server Parameters** section for details about the configuration file.

### Create a new database through the command line

As developers, we may need to use multiple databases. It is more convenient to create them through the command line.

If Odoo is running in a terminal window, press Ctrl + C to stop it and return to the command line.

Run the Odoo server with the -d option to create and initialize the Odoo database:

```
(env15) $ odoo -d 15-demo --stop-after-init
```

It will take some time to initialize the **15-demo** database. You will be returned to the command line after completion.

If you leave out the `--stop-after-init` option, the Odoo server will remain running after the database is ready. Now look carefully at the **INFO** log line with **Modules loaded** in the log messages. This means that the database has been started and can accept client calls. Note that this may not be the last log message, it will probably be in the last 3 or 4 lines.

By default, the database is initialized with demonstration data, which helps with development. This is the same as checking **Load demonstration data** when creating a new database in the user interface.

You can add `--without-demo=all` after the `odoo` command to initialize an empty database without demonstration data.

To create a new database, the user running Odoo must be a PostgreSQL superuser. If not, see the section Installing Odoo from source.

> Tips:
>
> It is fine to use a database superuser to run your Odoo instance in a development environment. However, in a production environment, Odoo security best practices require that you use a non-database superuser to run your Odoo service.

Now that you have a working instance and a database in place, open **http://localhost:8069** in your browser and you should be able to access the Odoo login page.

If you are unsure what hostname and port to use in the URL, check the Odoo service log messages. The first few lines of the startup log should contain this information. Something like:

```
INFO ? odoo.service.server: HTTP service (tool) running on MYMACHINE:8069
```

In Linux, you can also use the `hostname` command to find the host name, or the `ifconfig` command to find the IP address.

The default administrator account of Odoo is **admin**, and the password is also **admin**. After logging in, if the application has not been installed in the database, you will see the **Apps** menu showing the applications that can be installed.

You can stop the instance and return to the command line by pressing *Ctrl* + *C* in the terminal window running the Odoo server. Pressing the up arrow key will bring up the shell command you just used, so you can quickly start Odoo twice with the same options. Pressing *Ctrl* + *C*, then pressing the up arrow key and *Enter* is a common key combination for restarting the Odoo server during development.

At this point, Odoo has been successfully installed in the system and is ready for use. The database for the Odoo instance is also ready. Next, we will learn how to manage databases, create new databases, and delete those that are no longer needed.

## Managing Odoo Database

Earlier we learned how to create and initialize an Odoo database through the command line. There are many more commands worth learning to manage the database.

Although the Odoo service can automatically create a new PostgreSQL database, we can still use the following command to manually create a PostgreSQL database:

```
$ createdb MyDBName
```

This command with the `--template` parameter will copy an existing database. The copied database must not be connected, so make sure the Odoo instance is stopped when doing this.

> Tips:
>
> When running PostgreSQL in WSL, some operations may display messages like **WARNING: could not flush dirty data: Function not implemented**. You can circumvent this problem by modifying the PostgreSQL configuration file. For PostgreSQL 12, the configuration file is located at **/etc/postgresql/12/main/postgresql.conf**. Edit the file and add two lines, **fsync = off** and **data_sync_retry = true**. Then restart the PostgreSQL service using `sudo server posgresql restart`.

Use the following command to copy **MyDBName** original to **MyDBCopy**:

```
$ createdb --template=MyDBName MyDBCopy
```

Use the PostgreSQL **psql** tool to add the `-l` parameter to view the existing database:

```
$ psql -l
```

This will list the databases created so far. If you executed the previous command, it should list **MyDBName** and **MyDBCopy**. This list will also include the encoding of each database. The default is **UTF-8**, which is the encoding required by Odoo databases.

To delete a database that is no longer in use (or that you want to rebuild), execute the dropdb command:

```
$ dropdb MyDBCopy
```

Now we have learned the basics of database. To learn more about PostgreSQL, please refer to the [official documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/) and the [psql documentation page](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/app-psql.html).

> **Warning:** Data deletion by the dropdb command is irreversible. Be sure to back up the database when executing this command on an important database.

So far, our Odoo has been successfully running and we already know how to manage the project database or conduct experiments. But we still need to learn some of the most relevant Odoo server configuration parameters and how to store them conveniently in the configuration file.

## Configure Odoo server parameters

The Odoo server also supports some other parameters. You can view all available parameters through `--help`:

```
(env15) $ odoo --help
```

We will learn some important parameters in the following sections. First, let's learn how to use the configuration file.

### Odoo server configuration file

Most of the parameters can be saved in a configuration file. By default Odoo uses .odoorc files. The default path is in your home directory ($HOME) on Linux systems, and in the same directory as the executable file that runs Odoo on Windows.

> **Note:** In older versions of Odoo/OpenERP, the default configuration file was .openerp-serverrc. To maintain backward compatibility, this file will be used if it exists and .odoorc is not present.

The .odoorc configuration file is not automatically created in a new installation. We should use the `--save` parameter to store the configuration of the current instance. If the configuration file does not exist, a default configuration file will be created:

```
(env15) $ odoo --save --stop-after-init
```

The `--stop-after-init` parameter used here stops the service after the execution is completed.

> Note: Command line arguments can be shortened to avoid confusion, e.g. `--stop-after-init` can be shortened to `--stop`.

Now you can view the default content in the configuration file by running the following command:

```
$ cat ~/.odoorc # Display configuration file
```

The above command will display all configuration items and their default values. The edited parameters will take effect the next time you start the Odoo instance. Type q to exit and return to the command line.

Use ` --conf=<filepath> ` or the equivalent ` -c <filepath> ` shorthand argument to specify a configuration file.

For example, the following command creates a new configuration file **15-demo.conf** in the **~/work15** directory:

```
(env15) $ odoo -c ~/work15/15-demo.conf --save --stop
```

The following command uses this configuration file to start the Odoo service:

```
( env15 ) $ odoo -c ~ / work15 / 15 - demo . conf
```

### Modify the listening port

By default, the Odoo server uses port 8069. To use a different port, use the ` --http-port=<port> ` parameter or its short form ` -p <port> `. This is useful when running multiple instances on the same machine.

> **Changes in Odoo 11:** In Odoo 11, the `--http-port` parameter is introduced to replace the `--xmlrpc-port` used in previous versions

Let's try it out. Open two terminals and enter the command in the first one:

```
$ source ~/work15/env15/bin/activate
(env15) $ odoo --http-port=8070
```

In the second one, enter the command:

```
$ source ~/work15/env15/bin/activate
(env15) $ odoo --http-port=8071
```

At this point, we have two Odoo instances running on the same machine using different ports. The two instances can use the same database or different databases, depending on the configuration parameters we use, and the two ports can also run the same or different versions of Odoo.

> **Tip:** Different Odoo versions must use different databases. Trying to use the same database on different versions will not work properly because the major versions use incompatible database modes.

### Filter the list of accessible databases

The `--database` or `-d` parameter sets the database used by the Odoo server instance. All calls to the server will use this database, and calls to other databases will be rejected. This happens when the Odoo server is restarted to use a different database, while the page opened in the web window is still using the previous database session.

The same Odoo server can use multiple databases. This is the default behavior when no database is selected (the `--database` parameter is not set in the command line, configuration files, or the default configuration **~/.odoorc**). At this time, a new browser session will open the database management page and let us select the database we want to use.

If no database is specified, all databases will be shown. Use the `--db-filter` parameter to limit the databases available to the Odoo server.

The value of `--db-filter` can be a comma-separated list of database names or a regular expression. For example, the expression to filter out the **15-demo** name is:

Here are some examples of commonly used regular expressions:

- To filter out names that start with certain text, use the **^** prefix. For example, **^15** will filter out all names that start with **15**.
- To filter out names ending with certain text, use the **$** suffix. For example, **demo$** will filter out all names ending with **demo**.
- Use the combination of **^** prefix and **$** suffix to do exact match filtering. For example, **^15-demo$** can only match the database name **15-demo**.
- Use **.** to filter an optional single character. For example, **^15-demo.$** can match **15-demo**, **15-demo1**, **15-demo2**, etc.
- Use **.*** to filter optional character sequences (i.e. any number of characters). For example, **^15.*demo$** can match **15-emo**, **15-demo** or **15-this-is-a-demo**, etc.

### Manage server log messages

By default Odoo prints server log messages to standard output, thus in your terminal window.

The following is an example of a log line:

```
2021-11-08 08:06:57,786 18592 INFO 15-demo odoo.modules.loading: Modules loaded.
```

Each log line follows a structure that contains the following:

- **2021-11-08 08:06:57,786**: The date and time stamp of the log message uses UTC, not local time.
- **18592**: PID, the system's process ID.
- **INFO**: Log level of the message.
- **15-demo**: Database name. Displayed as **?** for operations not performed in the context of a featured database.
- **werkzeug**: Odoo modules that output messages. For example **odoo.modules.loading** is used for module loading operations.

The remaining text records the content of the message.

HTTP request message text has a specific structure, which is handled by the **werkzeug** module. For example:

```
2021-11-08 08:06:57,786 18592 INFO 15-demo tool: 127.0.0.1 - - [08/Apr/2020 08:06:57] "POST /web/dataset/call_kw/res.partner/read HTTP/1.1" 200 - 213 0.135 0.092
```

Here we can see the details of the HTTP request made, including the source IP address, the endpoint called, and the HTTP status code.

You can also see the performance information at the end of the text message: the last 3 numbers. In the example above, they are **213 0.135 0.092**. The meaning of these performance numbers is:

- Number of queries, i.e. the number of SQL queries executed
- The time it takes to run the SQL query
- Time spent outside of SQL (mostly in Python code)

For logging, we can control two configurations: where the log is output and how much information is logged.

`--log-level` is used to control the amount of information logged. The default setting is **info** level.

To reduce the amount of log information, you can set the log level to one of the following:

- **warn** only show warnings and errors
- **error** only show errors
- **critical** only show errors that prevent the server from running normally

Increasing the log level can help understand some problems on the server side. There are also more informative log levels:

- **debug** Enable debug level information
- **debug_sql** displays the SQL queries executed
- **debug_rpc** displays details of received RPC requests
- **debug_rpc_answer** displays the details of the RPC response sent back to the client

You can test different log levels by adding parameters to the service startup command, as shown in the following example:

```
(env15) $ odoo --log-level=debug_sql
```

Then, browse some pages on the web side and see if there is anything different in the server log.

`--log-handler` allows us to set the logging level for specific modules in a more granular manner. The format used is `--log-handler=MODULE1:LEVEL,MODULE2:LEVEL,...`. One way to find out what module name should be used is to look at the messages written to the log. The logging level can be **DEBUG**, **INFO**, **WARN**, **ERROR**, or **CRITICAL** (all uppercase).

For example, to increase the load module log message to debug, use the following command:

```
(env15) $ odoo --log-handler=odoo.modules:DEBUG
```

To reduce the amount of log information for HTTP request processing, use the following command:

```
(env15) $ odoo --log-handler=werkzeug:WARN
```

Regarding the location of log output, it is redirected to standard output (terminal interface) by default, but it can also be directed to a log file. This can be achieved using ` --logfile=<filepath> `, as follows:

```
(env15) $ odoo –logfile=~/work15/odoo.log
```

> Note: In Linux, log files are usually placed in the **/var/log** directory. Therefore, Odoo's log files are usually located in **var/log/odoo/**.

Now that we know how to control our Odoo instance and important server-side parameters, we can move on to more advanced operations. We can benefit from community-provided Odoo modules, as a key skill is learning how to use these modules in our Odoo instance.

## Find and install community plugins

The Odoo ecosystem has a rich community with a large number of modules. Installing new modules in your Odoo instance is often confusing for beginners. But it doesn't have to be this way.

### Find community modules

The [Odoo App Store](https://apps.odoo.com/) is a module catalog where you can download modules and install them into your system.

Another important resource is the Odoo Community Association (OCA), which hosts community-maintained modules. These modules are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/OCA/) at <https://github.com/OCA>. <https://odoo-community.org/shop> provides a searchable index.

OCA is a non-profit organization that coordinates community contributions, improves software quality, and promotes best development practices and open source values. You can learn more about OCA at [https://odoo-community.org](https://odoo-community.org/).

To add a module to Odoo, just copy it to the addons folder where the official plugin is located. In the previous example, the plugin directory is located in **~/work15/odoo/addons/**. But this is not a good practice. The Odoo we installed is a code repository controlled by Git version control. We hope that it will be synchronized with the upstream GitHub repository. Mixing external plugins in it will be unfavorable for management.

To avoid this problem, we can choose other directories to store these modules, and let the Odoo service look for modules from these directories. Not only can we put custom modules in a different directory without mixing them with official ones, but we can also organize these modules through different directories.

We can prepare the plug-in module for Odoo installation by downloading the system course code, getting the source code on GitHub, and executing the following command:

```
$ cd ~/work15
$ git clone https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Odoo-15-Development-Essentials.git library
```

This will change your working directory to **~/work15** and download the code from the GitHub repository for this book into the **library/** subdirectory. Next you need to tell Odoo where the new module is located.

### Configure add-ons path

The addons_path configuration parameter of Odoo lists the directories where the server should look for modules. By default, it points to two directories: one for the server's internal code containing the base module, and the other to the plugins directory, which contains standard modules and applications. For the configuration in the rest of this article, it should be ~/work15/odoo/odoo/addons,~/work15/odoo/addons.

We enable the server using the plugin path that contains the new module directory:

```
$ cd ~/work15
$ source env15/bin/activate
(env15) $ odoo -d 15-library --addons-path="./library,./odoo/addons"
```

The above command ensures that we are in the working directory and that the Python virtual environment is activated. Then, Odoo is started with two options: the name of the database to be used by Odoo, **15-library**, and the path to the plugins to be used. To simplify the information, relative paths are used here.

After the service starts, look carefully at the first few lines of the log. There should be a log message reporting the addon paths used, similar to **INFO ? odoo: addons paths: [...]** . Make sure it contains the **library/** directory;

Now that you have learned how to add third-party modules to your Odoo instance, you can start developing your own modules. There are several Odoo server-side parameters that can help you develop. It is helpful to understand them before you start coding.

## Using server-side development mode

Odoo also provides a server-side development mode, which can be enabled using the `--dev=all` parameter.

Development mode enables several features that speed up the development cycle:

- Automatically reload Python code when code files are saved, without manually restarting the server.
- Changes to view definitions take effect immediately, without the need to manually upgrade the module (note that you still need to reload the page in the browser).

`--dev=all` parameter will call **pdb** Python debugger when an exception is thrown. It is helpful for post-analysis of server-side errors. For more details about Python debugging commands, see <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#debugger-commands>.

The `--dev` parameter can take a comma-separated list of parameters, although the **all** parameter is suitable in most cases. The default Python debugger used is **pdb**. This debugger is a bit terse, and there are other debuggers available. Supported external debuggers are **pdb**, **pudb**, and **wpdb**.

To automatically reload after detecting code file modifications, you must install the **watchdog** Python package:

```
(env15) $ pip install watchdog
```

The use of the debugger will be discussed in [Chapter 8 Business Logic Development in Odoo 15 - Business Process Support](8.md).

## Odoo command line quick reference manual

Here is a quick guide to the most important Odoo commands:

- **-c,`--conf=my.conf`**: Set the configuration file to be used.

- **`--save`**: Save the configuration file.

- **`--stop`,`--stop-after-init`**: Stop the service after loading the module.

- **-d,`--database=mydb`**: Use this database.

- **` --db-filter=^mydb$ `**: Use a regular expression to filter available databases.

- **-p,`--http-port=8069`**: The port used by the HTTP service.

- **-i,`--init=MODULES`**: Install modules from a comma-separated list.

- **-u,`--update=MODULES`**: Update modules in a comma-separated list.

- **`--log-level=debug`**: Log level. Includes **debug**, **debug_sql**, **debug_rpc**, **debug_rpc_answer** and **warn**. Options for debugging specific core modules are:

    - **`--log-sql`**: debug **SQL** calls
    - **`--log-request`**: debug HTTP request calls
    - **`--log-response`:** Debug responses of HTTP calls
    - **`--log-web`**: call=HTTP request response

- **`--log-handler=MODULE:LEVEL`**: Set the log level of the specified module. The following is an example:

    - **`--log-handler=werkzeug:WARN`**
    -   **`--log-handler=odoo.addons:DEBUG`**

- **`--logfile=<filepath>`:** Send logs to a file.

- **`--dev=OPTIONS`: options include ** **all**, [**pudb**|**wdb**|**ipdb**|**pdb**], **reload**, **qweb**, **werkzeug**, and **xml**.

## Summary

In this chapter, we learned how to configure an Ubuntu system to host Odoo and install Odoo from GitHub sources. We also learned how to create an Odoo database and run an Odoo instance.

After completing this chapter, the reader should have a functioning Odoo environment and be able to manage databases and Odoo instances.

At this point, we can get down to business. In the next chapter, we will create our first Odoo module from scratch and learn about its main elements.
