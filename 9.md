# Chapter 9 Odoo 15 Development External API - Integrating Third-Party Systems

The Odoo server provides an external API that can be used by web clients and other client applications. In this chapter, we will learn how to use Odoo's external API to implement external applications that use the Odoo server as a backend.

You can write scripts to load or modify Odoo data, or integrate Odoo's existing business applications as a supplement to Odoo applications.

We will describe how to use Odoo RPC calls, and then use what we have learned to create a simple command line application for the book application using Python.

The main contents of this chapter are:

* Introduce learning project: Client application of book catalog
* Configure Python on the client machine
* Explore Odoo's external API
* Implement XML-RPC interface for client applications
* Implement the user interface of the client application
* Using OdooRPC library

After completing this chapter, you will be able to create a simple Python application that uses Odoo as a backend for querying and data storage.

## Development Preparation

This article is based on the code created in [Chapter 3 Odoo 15 Development: Creating the First Odoo Application](3.md). For the specific code, please refer to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/iTranslateX/odoo-essentials/tree/main/source-code). The library_app module should be placed in the addons path and installed. For consistency, we will use the installation operations in [Chapter 2 Odoo 15 Development: Preparing the Development Environment](2.md). For the completed code of this chapter, please refer to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/iTranslateX/odoo-essentials/tree/main/source-code/ch09).

## Learning Project-Book Catalog Client

In this article, we will develop a simple client application to manage a book catalog. This is a command line interface (CLI) application that uses Odoo as a backend. The application's functionality is very basic, and the core is the technology used to interact with the Odoo server.

This simple CLI application can perform the following functions:

* Search and list books by title
* Add new books to the catalog
* Edit book title

Our main goal is to use Odoo's external API, so we don't want to refer to other programming languages ​​that readers may not be familiar with. With this starting point, the best way is to use Python to implement the client application. However, as long as you master the XML-RPC library of one language, the relevant techniques for handling RPC are also applicable to other languages.

This application is a Python script that waits for input commands to perform operations. The following is an example:

```
$ python3 library.py add "Moby-Dick"
$ python3 library.py list "moby"
60 Moby-Dick
$ python3 library.py set 60 "Moby Dick"
```

This sample session demonstrates how to add, list, and modify book titles using the client application.

The client application runs in Python. Before you start writing the client application code, you should make sure that Python is installed on the client machine.

## Install Python on the client machine

The Odoo API can be accessed externally through two protocols: XML-RPC and JSON-RPC. Any external program that is a client that implements one of these protocols can interact with the Odoo server. To avoid introducing other programming languages, we will keep using Python to explore the external API.

So far we have only run Python code on the server. Now we are going to use Python on the client, so you may need to do some additional setup on your computer.

To follow the examples in this article, you need to be able to run Python 3 code on your computer. If you have configured your development environment in the previous section, you should already have it ready. Otherwise, install Python.

You can confirm this by running the command `python3 --version` in the command line terminal. If it is not installed, please refer to the official website to find the [installation package](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for your platform.

Python 3 is usually pre-installed in Ubuntu. If it is not installed, you can install it with the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
```

If you are using Windows 10, you can install it through the Microsoft Store.

Running **python3** in PowerShell will directly guide you to the corresponding download page (is this a benefit added by Uncle Turtle after joining Microsoft?).

Windows users who installed Odoo via the one-click installer may wonder why the Python interpreter is not ready. This requires additional installation. The simple answer is that the Odoo one-click installer has a built-in Python interpreter that is not directly available at the operating system level.

Now that you have Python installed, you can start using the Odoo external API.

## Learn Odoo External API

Before implementing a client application you should first be familiar with the Odoo external API. In the following sections we will explore the XML-RPC API using the Python interpreter.

### Connecting to the Odoo API using XML-RPC

The easiest way to access Odoo services is using XML-RPC, which we can do using the `xmlrpclib` from the Python standard library.

Don't forget that we are going to write a client program to connect to the server, so we need to run an Odoo server instance for connection. In this example, we assume that the Odoo server instance is running on the same machine, **http://localhost:8069**, but readers can use any other machine running the service, as long as they can connect to its IP address or server name.

Odoo's **xmlrpc/2/common** endpoint exposes public methods that can be accessed without logging in. It can be used to check the server version and detect login information. We use the **xmlrpc** library to study the publicly accessible Odoo API **common**.

First open a Python 3 terminal and enter the following code:

```
>>> from xmlrpc import client
>>> srv = "http://localhost:8069"
>>> common = client.ServerProxy("%s/xmlrpc/2/common" % srv)
>>> common.version()
{'server_version': '15.0', 'server_version_info': [15, 0, 0, 'final', 0, ''], 'server_serie': '15.0', 'protocol_version': 1}
```

The above code imports the **xmlrpc** library and creates a variable containing the server address and listening port information. Please modify it according to your own situation (for example, Alan uses `srv = 'http://192.168.0.12:8069'`).

The next step is to access the server's public service (without logging in), which is exposed on the **/xmlrpc/2/common** endpoint. One of the available methods is **version()**, which is used to check the server version. We use this to confirm that we can communicate with the server.

Another public method is **authenticate()**. This method confirms that the username and password are acceptable and returns a user ID that can be used for subsequent requests. The following is an example:

```
>>> db, user, password = "odoo-dev", "admin", "admin"
>>> uid = common.authenticate(db, user, password, {})
>>> print(uid)
2
```

The authenticate() method accepts four parameters: database name, username, password, and user agent. The previous code stores this information in variables and then uses these variables to pass parameters.

> Changes in ODOO 14
>
> Odoo 14 supports API keys, which can be used to gain external access to the Odoo API. API keys can be set in the user's Preferences form, under the Account Security tab.

The User Agent environment is used to provide meta information about the client. It is a required field and at least an empty dictionary **{}** should be passed.

If verification fails, the return value is **False**.

**common** The content of the public endpoint is very limited. To access the ORM API or other endpoints, you need to verify your account first.


![Odoo 15 Python client access XML RPC](https://p9-juejin.byteimg.com/tos-cn-i-k3u1fbpfcp/4622f2721fe54fc7b7d0caf633914c0a~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-watermark.image?)

### Running server-side methods using XML-RPC

To access Odoo models and methods, you need to use **xmlrpc/2/object**. This endpoint requires logging in before requesting.

This endpoint exposes a generic execute_kw method that takes a model name, a method to call, and a list of arguments to pass to the method.

Here is an example that demonstrates **execute_kw**. It calls the **search_count** method to return the number of records that match the domain filter:

```
>>> api = client.ServerProxy('%s/xmlrpc/2/object' % srv)
>>> api.execute_kw(db, uid, password, 'res.users', 'search_count', [[]])
3
```

Here we use the **xmlrpc/2/endpoint** object to access the server API. The method called is named **execute_kw()** and receives the following parameters:

* Database name to connect to
* Connection user ID
* User password (or API key)
* Target model name
* The method to call
* Positional parameter list
* Optional dictionary of keyword arguments (not used in this example)

All model methods can be called, except those starting with an underscore (**_**), which are private methods. Some methods cannot be called using the XML-RPC protocol if their return value cannot be sent via XML-RPC. The **browse()** method is such a case, it returns a recordset object. Calling **browse()** using XML-RPC will return an error **TypeError: cannot marshal objects**. When making an XML-RPC call, **browse()** should be replaced with **read** or **search_read**, and the returned data format can be sent to the client via the XML-RPC protocol.

Next, let's take a look at how to query Odoo data through **search** and **read**.

### Using API methods **search** and **read**

The Odoo server uses **browse** to query records. It cannot be used in an RPC client because recordset objects cannot be transferred via the RPC protocol. The **read** method should be used instead.

**read([<ids>, [<fields>])** is similar to the **browse** method, but it returns a list of records instead of a recordset. Each record is a dictionary containing the requested fields and data.

Let's see how to get data from Odoo using **read()**:

```
>>> api = client.ServerProxy("%s/xmlrpc/2/object" % srv)
>>> api.execute_kw(db, uid, password, "res.users", "read", [2, ["login", "name", "company_id"]])
[{'id': 2, 'login': 'admin', 'name': 'Mitchell Admin', 'company_id': [1, 'YourCompany']}]
```

The above example calls the read method on the res.users model, passing in two positional arguments: the record ID 2 (a list of IDs can also be used) and the list of fields to be retrieved ["login", "name", "company_id"] . No keyword arguments are passed.

The result is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary corresponds to a record. There is a specific representation for the value of multiple fields. A pair consisting of a record ID and a record display name. For example, the value of **company_id** returned in the above example is **[1, 'YourCompany']**.

The record ID may not be known, in which case you will need to use a **search** call to find those record IDs that match the domain filter.

For example, if you want to find the administrator user, you can use **[("login", "=", "admin")]**. This RPC call is as follows:

```
>>> domain = [("login", "=", "admin")]
>>> api.execute_kw(db, uid, password, "res.users", "search", [domain])
[2]
```

The result is a list with only one element (**2**), which is the ID of the **admin** user.

It is common to use the **search** method in conjunction with the **read** method to find IDs that match the domain filter criteria and then retrieve their data. In client applications, this will repeatedly call the server. This can be simplified by using the **search_read** method, which can perform the above two operations in one step.

The following example uses **search_read** to find the admin user and return its name:

```
>>> api.execute_kw(db, uid, password, "res.users", "search_read", [domain, ["login", "name"]])
[{'id': 2, 'login': 'admin', 'name': 'Mitchell Admin'}]
```

The search_read method takes two positional arguments: a list containing the domain filters, and another list containing the fields to retrieve.

The parameters of **search_read** are as follows:

* **domain:** Domain filter expression list
* **fields:** List of field names to be obtained
* **offset:** The number of records to skip or used for paging
* **limit:** The maximum number of records returned
* **order:** A string used for the **ORDER BY** statement

For both read and search_read, fields is an optional argument. If not provided, all model fields will be retrieved. However, this may use expensive field calculations and return a lot of unnecessary data. Therefore, it is recommended to provide an explicit list of fields.

The execute_kw call can use both positional and keyword arguments. Here is an example of replacing positional arguments with keyword arguments:

```
>>> api.execute_kw(db, uid, password, "res.users", "search_read", [], {"domain": domain, "fields": ["login", "name"]})
[{'id': 2, 'login': 'admin', 'name': 'Mitchell Admin'}]
```

The most commonly used method for retrieving data is search_read, but there are other methods for writing data or triggering other business logic.

### Calling other API methods

All other model methods are also exposed through RPC, except for private methods starting with an underscore. This means that you can call **create**, **write**, and **unlink** to modify data on the server.

Let's look at an example. The following code creates a new partner record, modifies the record, reads the record to see if the modification was written, and finally deletes it:

```
>>> x = api.execute_kw(db, uid, password, "res.partner",
... "create",
... [{'name': 'Packt Pub'}])
>>> print(x)
63
>>> api.execute_kw(db, uid, password, "res.partner",
... "write",
... [[x], {'name': 'Packt Publishing'}])
True
>>> api.execute_kw(db, uid, password, "res.partner",
... "read",
... [[x], ["name"]])
[{'id': 63, 'name': 'Packt Publishing'}]
>>> api.execute_kw(db, uid, password, "res.partner",
... "unlink",
... [[x]])
True
>>> api.execute_kw(db, uid, password, "res.partner",
... "read",
... [[x]])
[]
```

One limitation of XML-RPC is that it does not support the None value. There is an XML-RPC plugin that supports the None value, but this depends on the XML-RPC library used by the client. Methods without a return value may not work with XML-RPC because these methods implicitly return None. This is why it is a best practice for methods to have a return value, at least True. Another option is to use JSON-RPC. The OdooRPC library supports this protocol and will be used in the Using the OdooRPC library section of this article.

Methods in the model that begin with an underscore are considered private methods and cannot be exposed via XML-RPC.

> **Tip**: Often client applications want to copy what the user has entered in an Odoo form. Calling the **create()** method may not be enough, because the form may use the **onchange** method to automate some fields, which is triggered by form interaction and does not go through **create()**. The solution is to create a custom method in Odoo that uses the **create()** method and runs the actions in the **onchange** method.

It must be reiterated that Odoo's external API can be used in most programming languages. The [official documentation](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/15.0/developer/api/external_api.html) contains examples for Ruby, PHP and Java.

So far, we have learned how to use the XML-RPC protocol to call Odoo methods. Next, we will use it to build a book catalog client application.

## Implement the book client XML-RPC interface

Next, we will implement the book catalog client application.

It can be divided into two files: one for the Odoo backend interface containing the server backend, **library_xmlrpc.py**, and another for the user interface, **library.py**. This allows us to use alternative implementations of the backend interface.

Let's start with the Odoo backend component. The LibraryAPI class is used to configure the connection with the Odoo server to support the methods required to interact with Odoo. The methods to be implemented are:

* **search_read(<title>)** Search book data by title
* **create(<title>)** Creates a book with the specified title
* **write(<id>, <title>)** Update the title using the book ID
* **unlink(<id>)** Delete a book using its ID

Select a directory on your computer to store the application files and create the **library_xmlrpc.py** file. First add the class constructor as follows:

```
import xmlrpc.client

class LibraryAPI:
    def __init__(self, host, port, db, user, pwd):
        common = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(
            "http://%s:%d/xmlrpc/2/common" % (host, port))
        self.api = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(
            "http://%s:%d/xmlrpc/2/object" % (host, port))
        self.uid = common.authenticate(db, user, pwd, {})
        self.pwd = pwd
        self.db = db
        self.model = "library.book"
```

The class stores all the information needed to perform a call to the target module: API XML-RPC reference, **uid**, password, database name, and model name.

The RPC calls to Odoo will use the same execute_kw RPC method. Let's add a layer of wrapper around it and put it in the private method _execute(). It uses the data stored in the object to provide a smaller function signature, as shown in the following code:

```
    def _execute(self, method, arg_list, kwarg_dict=None):
        return self.api.execute_kw(
            self.db, self.uid, self.pwd, self.model,
            method, arg_list, kwarg_dict or {})
```

The **_execute()** private method is used to make higher-level method implementations more concise.

The first public method is search_read(). It accepts an optional string to search for the title of the book. If no title is provided, all records will be returned. The corresponding implementation is as follows:

```
    def search_read(self, title=None):
        domain = [("name", "ilike", title)] if title else []
        fields = ["id", "name"]
        return self._execute("search_read", [domain, fields])
```

The create() method is used to create a new book with a given title and returns the ID of the created record:

```
    def create(self, title):
        vals = {"name": title}
        return self._execute("create", [vals])
```

The **write()** method passes in the new book title and book ID as parameters to perform a write operation on the book:

```
    def write(self, id, title):
        vals = {"name": title}
        return self._execute("write", [[id], vals])
```

Finally, the **unlink()** method is used to delete the book with a given ID:

```
    def unlink(self, id):
        return self._execute("unlink", [[id]])
```

Add a test code at the end of the Python file to execute at runtime:

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test configuration
    host, port, db = "localhost", 8069, "odoo-dev"
    user, pwd = "admin", "admin"
    api = LibraryAPI(host, port, db, user, pwd)
    from pprint import pprint

    pprint(api.search_read())
```

If we execute the above Python script, we can print out the contents of the book:

```
$ python3 library_xmlrpc.py
[{'id': 3, 'name': 'Brave New World'},
 {'id': 2, 'name': 'Odoo 11 Development Cookbook'},
 {'id': 1, 'name': 'Odoo Development Essentials 11'}]
```

Now that we have a simple wrapper around the Odoo backend, we can move on to the command line user interface.

## Implement the client user interface

My goal is to learn how to write an interface between an external application and an Odoo service, which I have already achieved. But we can't stop there, let's build a user interface for this minimal client application.

To keep it as simple as possible, we use a simple command line user interface and avoid using other dependencies. We can use Python built-in functions and the ArgumentParser library to implement this command line application. The code is as follows:

```
from argparse import ArgumentParser
from library_xmlrpc import LibraryAPI
```

Next, let's look at the commands received by the parameter parser. There are four commands:

* **list** Search and list books
* **add** Add a book
* **set** Modify the title
* **del** delete book

The command line parsing code to implement the above commands is as follows:

```
parser = ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument(
    "command",
    choices=["list", "add", "set", "del"])
parser.add_argument("params", nargs="*") # optional parameters
args = parser.parse_args()
```

The args object here represents the parameters passed in by the user. **args.command** is the command used, and when **args.params** is given, it stores the other parameters used by the command.

If no parameters are passed or the parameters are incorrect, the parameter parser will process them and prompt the user for what to enter. For a more complete description of argparse, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html).

The next step is to perform operations in response to user input. We first create a **LibraryAPI** instance. This requires providing detailed Odoo connection information, which is hard-coded in our simple implementation. The code is as follows:

```
host, port, db = "localhost", 8069, "odoo-dev"
user, pwd = "admin", "admin"
api = LibraryAPI(host, port, db, user, pwd)
```

The first line of code sets some fixed parameters for the service instance and the database to connect to. In this example, we connect to the local Odoo server (localhost), listen on the default port **8069**, and use the **odoo-dev** database. If you need to connect to a different server and database, please adjust the parameters accordingly.

We need to add code to handle each command. Let's start with the list command that returns a list of books:

```
if args.command == "list":
    title = args.params[:1]
    if len(title) != 0:
        title = title[0]
    books = api.search_read(title)
    for book in books:
        print("%(id)d %(name)s" % book)
```

Here we use **LibraryAPI.search_read()** to get the list of book records from the server. Then we iterate through each element in the list and print it.

Add the add command below:

```
if args.command == "add":
    title = args.params[0]
    book_id = api.create(title)
    print("Book added with ID %d for title %s." % (book_id, title))
```

Since the main work has been done in the **LibraryAPI** object, we just need to call the **create()** method and display the result to the end user.

The **set** command allows us to modify the title of an existing book. Two parameters should be passed in: the new title and the book's ID:

```
if args.command == "set":
    if len(args.params) != 2:
        print("set command requires a Title and ID.")
    else:
        book_id, title = int(args.params[0]), args.params[1]
        api.write(book_id, title)
        print("Title of Book ID %d set to %s." % (book_id, title))
```

Finally, we need to implement the **del** command to delete book records. The implementation method is no different from before:

```
if args.command == "del":
    book_id = int(args.params[0])
    api.unlink(book_id)
    print("Book with ID %s was deleted." % book_id)
```

Now that the client application is complete, you can try out some commands. You should be able to execute the commands at the beginning of this article.

> Tips: In Linux, you can make the library.py file executable by executing the chmod +x library.py command and adding #!/usr/bin/env python3 to the first line of the file. You can then run ./library.py in the command line.

This is a very basic application, and there are many ways to improve it. Our goal is to build a minimal viable application using the Odoo RPC API.

![Odoo 15 Client RPC Command Line Interface](https://p6-juejin.byteimg.com/tos-cn-i-k3u1fbpfcp/a552e006bea94d00b69c8e58b4855939~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-watermark.image?)

## Using the OdooRPC library

Another client library you can consider is OdooRPC. It is a complete client library that replaces the XML-RPC protocol with the JSON-RPC protocol. In fact, the official Odoo client uses JSON-RPC, and XML-RPC is more used to support backward compatibility.

> ℹ️OdooRPC library is now managed and maintained by OCA. For more information, please see [OCA](https://github.com/OCA/odoorpc).

The OdooRPC library can be installed via PyPI:

```
pip3 install odoorpc
```

**OdooRPC** configures the server connection when creating a new **odoorpc.ODOO** object. At this point we should use the **ODOO.login()** method to create a user session. Like the server, members have an **env** property containing the session environment, including the user ID, **uid** and context.

The **OdooRPC** library can be used to provide an alternative implementation of the **library_xmlrpc.py** interface on the server side. The functionality is the same, but XML-RPC is replaced by JSON-RPC.

Create the **library_odoorpc.py** Python module to modify the **library_xmlrpc.py** module. Add the following code to the newly created **library_odoorpc.py** file:

```
import odoorpc

class LibraryAPI():
    def __init__(self, host, port, db, user, pwd):
        self.api = odoorpc.ODOO(host, port=port)
        self.api.login(db, user, pwd)
        self.uid = self.api.env.uid
        self.model = "library.book"
        self.Model = self.api.env[self.model]

    def _execute(self, method, arg_list, kwarg_dict=None):
        return self.api.execute(
            self.model,
            method, *arg_list, **kwarg_dict)
```

The OdooRPC library implements Model and Recordset objects to mimic the corresponding functionality on the server. The goal is that programming on the client should be basically the same as programming on the server. The method used by the client takes advantage of this and stores a reference to the library.book model in the self.Model property, which is provided by the OdooRPC env["library.book"] call.

The _execute() method is also implemented here, which can be compared with the XML-RPC version. The execute() method in the OdooRPC library runs the specified Odoo model method.

Next, we will implement the client methods **search_read()**, **create()**, **write()**, and **unlink()**. Add the following methods to the **LibraryAPI()** class in the same file:

```
    def search_read(self, title=None):
        domain = [("name", "ilike", title)] if title else []
        fields = ["id", "name"]
        return self.Model.search_read(domain, fields)

    def create(self, title):
        vals = {"name": title}
        return self.Model.create(vals)

    def write(self, id, title):
        vals = {"name": title}
        self.Model.write(id, vals)

    def unlink(self, id):
        return self.Model.unlink(id)
```

Note that this code is very similar to the Odoo server code.

You can use the **LibraryAPI** object to replace **library_xmlrpc.py**. You can use it as the RPC connection layer by editing the **library.py** file and replacing the line **from library_xmlrpc import LibraryAPI** with **from library_odoorpc import LibraryAPI**. Then test the **library.py** client application, and the execution effect should be the same as before.

## Understanding ERPpeek Client

ERPpeek is a versatile tool that can be used as both an interactive command line interface (CLI) and a Python library, which provides a more convenient API than the xmlrpc library. It is in the PyPi index and can be installed with the following command:

```
pip3 install erppeek
```

ERPpeek is not only available as a Python library, it can also be used as a CLI to perform administrative operations on the server. The Odoo shell command provides a local interactive session on the host, while the erppeek library provides a remote interactive session for clients on the network. Open the command line and use the following command to view the available options:

```
erppeek --help
```

Let's take a look at a sample session:

```
$ erppeek --server='http://127.0.0.1:8069' -d odoo-dev -uadmin
Usage (some commands):
    models(name) # List models matching pattern
    model(name) # Return a Model instance
...

Password for 'admin':
Logged in as 'admin'
odoo-dev >>> model('res.users').count()
3
odoo-dev >>> rec = model('res.partner').browse(14)
odoo-dev >>> rec.name
'Azure Interior'
```

As you can see above, a connection to the server is established, and the execution context references the model() method to obtain the model instance and operate on it. The erppeek.Client instance used for the connection is also available through the client variable. It is worth mentioning that it can replace the web client to manage installed plug-in modules:

* client.modules() lists available or installed modules
* client.install() performs module installation
* client.upgrade() performs module upgrade
* client.uninstall() uninstalls the module

Therefore, ERPpeek can be used as a good service for remote management of Odoo servers. For more details about ERPpeek, see [GitHub](https://github.com/tinyerp/erppeek).

## Summary

The goal of this article is to learn how external APIs work and what they can do. We'll start by exploring them through a simple Python XML-RPC client, but the external APIs are also available for other programming languages. In fact, the official documentation includes code examples for Java, PHP, and Ruby.

Then we learned how to use XML-RPC calls to search, read data, and how to call other methods. For example, we can create, update, and delete records.

Next we introduced the OdooRPC library. It provides a layer on top of the RPC base library (XML-RPC or JSON-RPC) to provide a local API similar to the server API. This reduces the learning curve, reduces programming errors and makes it easier to copy code between the server and the client.

That concludes our study of programming APIs and business logic. It’s time to dive into views and user interfaces. In the next article, we’ll learn more about backend views and the out-of-the-box user experience provided by the web client.
