# Chapter 12: Reports and QWeb Server Development in Odoo 12

This article is the twelfth in the series of [The best free ERP system Odoo 12 development manual](README.md).

Reports are a very valuable feature of business applications, and the built-in QWeb engine is the default engine for reports. Reports designed using QWeb templates can be generated into HTML files and converted into PDF. This means that we can easily use the QWeb knowledge we have learned and apply it to business reports. In this article, we will add a report to the library application and review the key techniques for generating reports using QWeb. This includes calculations such as summaries, translations, and paper-style printing.

The main contents of this article are:

- Install wkhtmltopdf
- Create business reports
- QWeb report template
- Display data in reports
- Rendering images
- Report summary
- Define paper format
- Enable language translation in reports
- Create reports using custom SQL



## Development Preparation

We will continue to use the library_app plugin module for learning, which was first created in Chapter 3 [Creating the first Odoo application](3.md), and then improved in Chapter 5 [Importing, exporting, and module data](5.md) and Chapter 6 [Models - Structured application data](6.md). The relevant code can be found in the [GitHub repository](source-code/chapter11). The code after this article is completed can also be found in the [GitHub repository](source-code/chapter12).

## Install wkhtmltopdf

To generate reports correctly, you should install the recommended version of the wkhtmltopdf tool, whose name stands for Webkit HTML to PDF. Odoo uses it to convert rendered HTML pages into PDF documents. Some versions of the wkhtmltopdf library are known to have problems, such as not printing the page header and footer, so you need to be selective about the version you use. Starting from Odoo 10, version 0.12.5 is officially supported and is also the officially recommended version.

> **Tip:** The official Odoo project has a wiki page that keeps information and recommendations for using wkthtmltopdf. It can be viewed via [GitHub](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/wiki/Wkhtmltopdf).

Unfortunately, your host system, whether it is Debian/Ubuntu or other systems, provides installation package versions that are inconsistent. So we should download and install the recommended version package for the current operating system and CPU type. Please see [GitHub](https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/releases) for the download link.

First, make sure that the wrong version is not installed on your system:

```
wkhtmltopdf --version
```

If the result printed by the above command is not the version we need, we should uninstall it. In Debian/Ubuntu system, the command used is as follows:

```
sudo apt-get remove --purge wkhtmltopdf
```

Next we need to download the installation package suitable for our system and install it. Check the [GitHub](https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/releases) download link. For 0.12.5, the latest Ubuntu installation version is for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS stable version, but it should also be effective for later Ubuntu systems. We install it in the recently released Ubuntu 64 system, the download command is as follows:

```
wget "https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/releases/download/0.12.5/wkhtmltox_0.12.5-1.bionic_amd64.deb" -O /tmp/wkhtml.deb
```

The next step is to install it. Installing the local deb file does not automatically install the dependencies, so you need to perform the second step to complete the installation:

```
sudo dpkg -i /tmp/wkhtml.deb
```

At this time, you may see an error about missing dependencies. The following command can solve this problem:

```
sudo apt-get -f install
```

Now we can check if the wkhtmltopdf library is installed correctly and confirm that it is the required version:

```
$ wkhtmltopdf --version
wkhtmltopdf 0.12.5 (with patched qt)
```

At this time, the startup log of the Odoo service will no longer prompt the message "You need Wkhtmltopdf to print a pdf version of the report".

## Create business report

We will continue to use the library_app module used in the previous article and add the files that implement the report. The report we will create will look like this

![Odoo 12 Book Project Business Report](http://alanhou.org/homepage/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/report-final.jpg)

Report files should be placed in the module subfolder /reports. First, let's add a reports/library_book_report.xml data file. Don't forget to import the file under data in the __manifest__.py file. First, declare a new report in the reports/library_book_report.xml file:

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<odoo>
    <report id="action_library_book_report"
        string="Library Books"
        model="library.book"
        report_type="qweb-pdf"
        name="library_app.report_library_book_template" />
</odoo>
```

The <report> tag is a shorthand for writing data to ir.actions.report.xml, which is a special type of customer action. Its data can be viewed through the Settings > Technical > Actions > Reports menu.

![Odoo 12 Technical menu view report](http://alanhou.org/homepage/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/technical-report.jpg)

> **Tip:** When designing a report, we may prefer to keep it as report_type="qweb-html" and then change it to qweb-pdf when finished. This will make it faster to generate reports in the QWeb template and easier to check the HTML results.

After performing the module upgrade (~/odoo-dev/odoo/-bin -d dev12 -u library_app), a Print button will appear at the top of the book form view (and also in the list view), to the left of the Actions button, with an added option to run a report (Library Books).

![Odoo 12 book project report generation menu](http://alanhou.org/homepage/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/library-book-report.jpg)

We can't generate a report yet, because we haven't defined it yet. This is a QWeb report, so we need to use a QWeb template. The name attribute identifies the template to use. Unlike other identifier references, the name attribute requires a module prefix, and we must use the full reference name <module_name>.<identifier_name>.

## QWeb report template

As you can see in the code below, this report follows a basic framework. Simply add the following code after the <report> element in the reports/library_book_report.xml file:

```
    <template id="report_library_book_template">
        <t t-call="web.html_container">
            <t t-call="web.external_layout">
                <div class="page">
                    <!-- Report header content -->
                    <t t-foreach="docs" t-as="o">
                        <!-- Report row content -->
                    </t>
                    <!-- Report footer content -->
                </div>
            </t>
        </t>
    </template>
```

The most important element here is the t-call directive that uses the standard report structure. The web.html_container template makes the basic settings to support the HTML document. The web.external_layout template handles the report header and footer with company-specific settings. It can be replaced with the web.internal_layout template, which will only use a basic header.

> ℹ️ **Changes in Odoo 11**
> The support layout for reports has been moved from the report module to the web module. That is to say, the references to **report**.external_layout or **report**.internal_layout in previous versions should be changed to web.<...> in 11.0.

The external_layout template can be customized by the user. Odoo 11 introduced this option in the Settings > General Settings menu, and then in the Business Documents > Document Template section:

![Odoo 12 external_layout template](http://alanhou.org/homepage/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/external-layout.jpg)

Here we can click Change Document Template to choose from several available templates, or even click Edit Layout to customize the XML of the selected template. This report framework is suitable for tabular reports, that is, each record in the report is displayed as a row. The report header usually displays the title, and the bottom area displays the summary.

Another format is a document report, where each record is a separate page, such as an email. In this case, the report structure is as follows:

```
    <template id="report_todo_task_template">
        <t t-call="web.html_container">
            <t t-call="web.external_layout">
                <t t-foreach="docs" t-as="o">
                    <div class="page">
                        <!-- Report content -->
                    </div>
                </t>
            </t>
        </t>
    </template>
```

We will create a tabular report, so we will use the same framework as before. Now we have the basic framework. Since the report is a QWeb template, it can be inherited like any other view. QWeb templates used in reports can be inherited using the same XPath expressions used for regular view inheritance.

Note: Clicking Print at this time will output a blank PDF file.

## Displaying data in a report

Unlike the kanban view, the QWeb template in the report is rendered on the server side, so it is implemented using Python QWeb. We can think of it as two implementations of the same specification, and we need to pay attention to some differences.

First of all, the QWeb expressions here are run with Python syntax, not JavaScript. For the simplest expressions there is almost no difference, but more complex operations may be different. The expression running context is also different. For reports, the following variables can be used:

- docs is an iterable collection of records to print
- doc_ids is a list of IDs of the records to be printed
- doc_model specifies the record model, such as library.book
- time is a reference to the Python time library
- user is the user record that runs the report
- res_company is the company record of the current user

You can use t-field to reference field values, and you can use t-options to supplement and specify specific components for rendering field contents.

> **ℹ️Changes in Odoo 11**
> In previous Odoo versions, the t-field-options attribute was used, but it has been deprecated in Odoo 11 and the t-options attribute is used instead.

For example, assuming that doc represents a specific record, the code is as follows:

```
<t t-field="doc.date_published"
    t-options="{'widget': 'date'}" />
```

Now we can start designing the report page content.

> **Tip:** Unfortunately, the official documentation does not cover the components and options supported by QWeb. So the only way to learn more about them is to read the corresponding source code. You can visit [ir_qweb_fields.py](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/12.0/odoo/addons/base/models/ir_qweb_fields.py), find the class that inherits ir.qweb.field, and the get_available_options() method can help you understand the supported options.

The report content is written in HTML, and Twitter Bootstrap 4 is used to help design the report layout. Bootstrap is used extensively in web development. For a complete guide to Bootstrap, please visit the official website.

The following is the XML code for rendering the report header, which should be placed in <div class="page"> and replace the existing <t t-foreach=...> element:

```
<!-- Report header content -->
<div class="container">
	<div class="row bg-primary">
	    <div class="col-3">Title</div>
	    <div class="col-2">Publisher</div>
	    <div class="col-2">Date</div>
	    <div class="col-3">Publisher Address</div>
	    <div class="col-2">Authors</div>
	</div>
	<t t-foreach="docs" t-as="o">
	    <div class="row">
	        <!-- Report row content -->
	    </div>
	</t>
	<!-- Report footer content -->
</div>
```

The layout of the content uses Twitter Bootstrap's HTML grid system. In general, Bootstrap uses a 12-column grid layout, and here the grid is inside a <div class="container"> element.

> ℹ️ **Changes in Odoo 12**
> Odoo now uses Bootstrap 4, which is not backwards compatible with Bootstrap 3 used in previous Odoo versions. For tips on switching from Bootstrap 3 to Bootstrap 4, refer to the Odoo Wiki page on the topic.

You can use <div class="row"> to add rows. Each row has multiple cells, each occupying a different number of columns, totaling 12 columns. Each cell can be defined by <div class="col-N">, where N represents the number of columns occupied.

> **Tip:** Bootstrap 4 uses CSS flexbox layout in most of its components, and wkhtmltopdf is known to not support all flexbox functions very well. So if something doesn't work, try using other elements or methods, such as HTML tables.

![Odoo 12 report header](http://alanhou.org/homepage/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/report-header.jpg)

Here we add a title to the header row, then use t-foreach to loop through each record and render each row. Because the rendering is done on the server, and records are objects, we can use dot notation to access fields from related data records. This also makes data access to related fields much easier. Note that this does not work in client-side rendered QWeb views, such as the kanban view in a web client.

The following is the XML for the record row content in the <div class="row"> element:

```
<!-- Report row content -->
<div class="col-3">
    <h4><span t-field="o.name" /></h4>
</div>
<div class="col-2">
    <span t-field="o.publisher_id" />
</div>
<div class="col-2">
    <span t-field="o.date_published"
        t-options="{'widget': 'date'}"/>
</div>
<div class="col-3">
    <span t-field="o.publisher_id"
        t-options='{
            "widget": "contact",
            "fields": ["address", "email", "phone", "website"],
            "no_marker": true}'/>
</div>
<div class="col-2">
    <!-- Render authors -->
</div>
```

You can see that fields can have additional options added via the t-options attribute, which contains a JSON dictionary with the widget key. A more complex example is the contact component, which is used to format addresses. We use it to render the publisher address o.publisher_id. By default, the contact component displays the address with an image, similar to a phone icon. The no_marker="true" option disables this display.

![Odoo 12 report address](http://alanhou.org/homepage/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/report-address.jpg)

Added: no_marker="true" disables the address icon as shown above

## Rendering the image

The last column of our report is a set of authors with avatars. We will render each author by looping through them and using the Bootstrap media object:

```
<!-- Render authors -->
<ul class="list-unstyled">
    <t t-foreach="o.author_ids" t-as="author">
        <li class="media">
            <span t-field="author.image_small"
                t-options="{'widget': 'image'}" />
            <div class="media-body">
                <p class="mt-0">
                    <span t-field="author.name" />
                </p>
            </div>
        </li>
    </t>
</ul>
```

Here we iterate over the author_ids and use the field image component <t t-field="..." t-options="{'widget': 'image'}"> to render each author's avatar, and then the name.

![Odoo 12 book project report author avatar](http://alanhou.org/homepage/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/report-authors.jpg)

Note: The above avatars are from the real avatars of the masters on Twitter

## Report Summary

It is often necessary to provide summaries in reports. This can be done by using Python expressions to calculate the total. After the closing <t t-foreach> tag, we add a final line for the summation:

```
<!-- Report footer content -->
<div class="row">
   <div class="col-3">
       Count: <t t-esc="len(docs)" />
   </div>
   <div class="col-2" />
   <div class="col-2" />
   <div class="col-3" />
   <div class="col-2" />
</div>
```

The len() Python function is used to count the number of elements in a collection. Similarly, we can use sum() to sum a set of values. For example, we can use the following list comprehension to calculate the total amount:

```
<t t-esc="sum([x.price for x in docs])" />
```

You can think of this list comprehension as a nested loop. Sometimes we need to perform some calculations throughout the report, such as a running total, summing up to the current record. This can be achieved by defining a cumulative variable with t-set to update it in each row. To illustrate this functionality, let's calculate the cumulative number of authors. First, initialize the variable before the docs recordset t-foreach loop:

```
<!-- Running total: initialize variable -->
<t t-set="author_count" t-value="0" />
```

Then, within the loop, we add the number of authors recorded to a variable. We display it here after the book title and print out the current total on each line:

```
<!-- Running total: increment and present -->
<t t-set="author_count" t-value="author_count + len(o.author_ids)" />
(Accum. authors: <t t-esc="author_count" />)
```

![Odoo 12 Book Project Report Summary](http://alanhou.org/homepage/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/report-totals.jpg)

## Define paper style

At this point, the HTML display of our report is fine, but it is not beautiful enough in the printed PDF page. Using a horizontal page will show better results, so let's add a paper style. Add the following code at the top of the report XML file:

```
    <record id="paperformat_euro_landscape"
        model="report.paperformat">
        <field name="name">European A4 Landscape</field>
        <field name="default" eval="True" />
        <field name="format">A4</field>
        <field name="page_height">0</field>
        <field name="page_width">0</field>
        <field name="orientation">Landscape</field>
        <field name="margin_top">40</field>
        <field name="margin_bottom">23</field>
        <field name="margin_left">7</field>
        <field name="margin_right">7</field>
        <field name="header_line" eval="False" />
        <field name="header_spacing">35</field>
        <field name="dpi">90</field>
    </record>
```

This is a copy of the European A4 format defined in the base module in the data/report_paperformat_data.xml file, but with the orientation changed from portrait to landscape. The defined paper formats can be viewed in the Settings > Technical > Reporting > Paper Format menu.

![Odoo 12 menu view paper style](http://alanhou.org/homepage/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/european-a4.jpg)

Now you can use it in your reports. The default paper style is defined in the company settings, but we can also specify the paper style for a specific report. This is done using the paperfomat property in the report action. Let's edit the action used to open the report and add this property:

```
    <report id="action_library_book_report"
...
        paperformat="paperformat_euro_landscape" />
```

![Odoo 12 Book Project Landscape Report](http://alanhou.org/homepage/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/report-landscape.jpg)

## Enable language translation in reports

To enable translation in a report, you need to call the translation method in the template using the <t t-call> element with the t-lang attribute. t-lang needs to be passed a language code to run, such as es or en_US. It requires the name of the field where the language to be used can be found. One way is to use the current user's language. To do this, we define an outer translation report to call the report to be translated and use the t-lang attribute to set the language source:

```
    <report id="action_library_book_report"
...
        name="library_app.report_library_book_translated"
        paperformat="paperformat_euro_landscape" />

    <template id="report_library_book_template">
        <t t-call="library_app.report_library_book_translated"
            t-lang="user.lang" />
    </template>
```

In this example, each book is rendered in the user's language, user_id.lang.

In some cases, we may need each record to be rendered in a specific language. For example, in a sales order, we may want each record to be printed in the preferred language of the corresponding partner/customer. Suppose we need each book to be rendered in the language of the corresponding publisher, the QWeb template can be written like this:

```
    <template id="report_library_book_translated">
        <t t-foreach="docs" t-as="o">
            <t t-call="library_app.report_library_book_template"
                t-lang="o.publisher_id.lang">
                <t t-set="docs" t-value="o" />
            </t>
        </t>
    </template>
```

In the above, we iterate the records, and then call the report template for each record using the corresponding language based on the data on the record. In this case, it is the publisher's language publisher_id.lang.

Supplement: When the above code is run, each record will have a header. If you want to display it in a list, you need to abstract the header outside the loop.

## Create a report using custom SQL

The reports we created so far are based on regular recordsets, but in some cases we need to perform some data transformations or accumulations that are not easy to handle in QWeb templates. One solution is to write native SQL queries to create the dataset we need, expose the results through a special model, and then generate a report based on this dataset.

We create the reports/library_book_report.py file to illustrate this situation. The code is as follows:

```
from odoo import models, fields

class BookReport(models.Model):
    _name = 'library.book.report'
    _description = 'Book Report'
    _auto = False

    name = fields.Char('Title')
    publisher_id = fields.Many2one('res.partner')
    date_published = fields.Date()

    def init(self):
        self.env.cr.execute("""
            CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW library_book_report AS
            (SELECT *
            FROM library_book
            WHERE active=True)
        """)
```

To load the above files, add from . import reports to your module’s top-level __init__.py file and from . import library_book_report to reports/__init__.py.

The _auto attribute is used to prevent the automatic creation of the database table. We added alternative SQL to the init() method of the model. It creates the database view and provides the data required for the report. The above SQL query is very simple and is intended to illustrate that we can use any valid SQL query for the view, such as performing accumulation or calculations on additional data.

We also need to declare the model fields so that Odoo knows how to properly handle the data in each record. Also don't forget to add security access rules for the new model, otherwise you won't be able to use the model. Add the following line to the security/ir.model.access.csv file:

```
access_library_book_report,access_library_book_report,model_library_book_report,
library_group_user,1,0,0,0
```

It should also be noted that this is a completely different model, and the access rules are different from those of the book model. Next, we can add a report based on this model using reports/library_book_sql_report.xml:

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<odoo>
    <report id="action_library_book_sql_report"
        string="Library Book SQL Report"
        model="library.book.report"
        report_type="qweb-html"
        name="library_app.report_library_book_sql" />

    <template id="report_library_book_sql">
        <t t-call="web.html_container">
            <t t-call="web.external_layout">
                <div class="page">
                    <!-- Report page content -->
                    <table class="table table-striped">
                        <tr>
                            <th>Title</th>
                            <th>Published</th>
                            <th>Date</th>
                        </tr>
                        <t t-foreach="docs" t-as="o">
                            <tr>
                                <td class="col-xs-6">
                                    <span t-field="o.name" />
                                </td>
                                <td class="col-xs-3">
                                    <span t-field="o.publisher_id" />
                                </td>
                                <td class="col-xs-3">
                                    <span t-field="o.date_published"
                                        t-options="{'widget': 'date'}" />
                                </td>
                            </tr>
                        </t>
                    </table>
                </div>
            </t>
        </t>
    </template>
</odoo>
```

For more complex cases, where we also need user input parameters, we can use a different solution: a wizard. For this we should create a temporary model to store the user's report parameters. Since this is generated by code, we can use any logic we want.

It is highly recommended to study existing similar reports for inspiration. A good example is Leaves by Department under the Leaves menu option. The corresponding temporary model definition can be found in addons/hr_holidays/wizard/hr_holidays_summary_employees.py.

Supplement: The original book did not verify this part. Alan verifies it by adding a menu item. There are other ways. Readers are welcome to leave comments for discussion.

First, add the following content to the views/library_menu.xml file:

```
    <act_window id="action_library_book_report"
        name="Book Report"
        res_model="library.book.report"
        view_mode="tree,form"
    />
    <menuitem id="menu_library_book_report"
        name="Book Report"
        parent="menu_library"
        action="action_library_book_report"
    />
```

Update the module after importing the aforementioned XML file in the __manifest__.py file

## Summarize

In the previous article, we learned about QWeb and how to use it to design dashboard views. In this article, we learned about the QWeb report engine and the most important techniques for creating reports using the QWeb template language.

In the next article, we will continue to use QWeb, this time to create web pages. We will learn to write web controllers to provide richer functionality for our web pages.
