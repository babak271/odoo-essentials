# Chapter 14 Odoo 12 Development Deployment and Maintenance Production Instance

This article is the fourteenth and final article in the [Best Free ERP System Odoo 12 Development Manual](README.md) series.

In this article, you will learn the basics of preparing an Odoo server for production use. Installing and maintaining a server is a complex topic that should be done by professionals. What you learn in this article is not enough to ensure that ordinary users can create a robust and secure environment that can handle sensitive data and services.

This article aims to introduce important configurations and best practices for Odoo deployment, so that system administrators can better prepare the Odoo server host. Through the study of this article, we will be able to create a relatively secure Odoo server that is sufficient for ordinary production environments. This article is not the only way to deploy Odoo, and other methods may also be applicable.

## Development Preparation

You don’t need to use the previously developed code in this chapter. For related code and scripts, please see the [GitHub repository](source-code).

## Install Odoo from source

Odoo has a Debian or Ubuntu installation package that allows you to implement a working service process and automatically start the service when the system boots. The installation process can be followed step by step, and relevant information can be found at https://nightly.odoo.com/. There are also rpm files for CentOS and .exe installation packages for Windows.

While this is easy and convenient to install Odoo, most people prefer to deploy and run integrations from source code that is version controlled. This gives you more control over what is deployed, and makes it easier to manage changes and fixes in production.

### Installation dependencies

When using the Debian distribution, the default login user is root with administrator privileges, and the command line displays #. In the Ubuntu system, the root account is disabled, and the initial user configured during installation can run root privilege commands through sudo. First, we should update the package index, and then perform an upgrade to ensure that all installed programs are up to date. The command is as follows:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Next, we will install the PostgreSQL database and make the current user a database superuser with the following commands:

```
sudo apt install postgresql -y
sudo su -c "createuser -s $USER" postgres
```

We will run Odoo from source, but before that, we need to install the required dependencies. Here are the required Debian packages:

```
sudo apt-get install git python3-dev python3-pip -y
sudo apt install build-essential libxslt-dev libzip-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev libssl-dev -y
```

Also remember to install wkhtmltox, which is required for printing reports. The command is as follows:

```
wget "https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/releases/download/0.12.5/wkhtmltox_0.12.5-1.xenial_amd64.deb" -O /tmp/wkhtml.deb
sudo dpkg -i /tmp/wkhtml.deb
sudo apt-get -fy install # Handle dependency errors
```

Note that dependency errors may be reported when installing the package. The last command here will force the installation of these dependencies and complete the installation correctly.

```
# error message
...
dpkg: error processing package wkhtmltox (--install):
 dependency problems - leaving unconfigured
Errors were encountered while processing:
 wkhtmltox
```

Now we are only missing the Python packages that Odoo needs, most of which have Debian or Ubuntu system packages. The official Debian installation packages use these, and you can find these package names in the debian/control file in the Odoo source code. But these Python dependencies can also be installed directly through PyPI (Python Package Index). The required packages are in the requirements.txt file of Odoo as usual for Python-based projects. We can install these packages with the following command:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/odoo/odoo/12.0/requirements.txt
sudo -H pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

In Ubuntu 18.04, the last command may print a red warning about uninstalling PyYAML and pySerial, which happens when older versions are installed via packages on the system. This warning can be safely ignored.

Now that we have all the dependencies, database services, system packages, and Python packages installed, we can install Odoo.

### Prepare independent system users

From a security perspective, it is recommended to run Odoo with a separate user that does not have any system privileges. To do this, we need to create a system and database user using the following commands:

```
sudo adduser --disabled-password --gecos "Odoo" odoo
sudo su -c "createuser odoo" postgres
createdb --owner=odoo odoo-prod
```

In the above, odoo is the username and odoo-prod is the name of the database that the Odoo instance is running under. The odoo user becomes the owner of the odoo-prod database. This means that it has create and delete permissions on the database, including the ability to delete the entire database. If you are running a multi-tenant server, you should create a specific system user like odoo for each tenant.

> **Tip:** Odoo is designed to run correctly even when the system user is not the database owner. But this may complicate the setup, and good practice to solidify security is to have a main system user as the database owner, and create a dedicated system user with no superuser privileges for each instance to run the service.

Note that these are ordinary users without administrative privileges. When a new system user is created, a home directory is automatically created. For example, /home/odoo. Users can use the ~ shortcut symbol to represent their home directory. We will use it in the configuration and files corresponding to the user Odoo. We can use the following command to open a session with this user:

```
sudo su odoo
exit
```

The exit command terminates the session and returns to the original user.

### Source code installation

It won't be long before your service needs to be upgraded or patched. This is when a version control repository is helpful. We use git to get the code from the repository, just like we did when we installed the development environment. Below I will use the odoo user and download the code to my home directory:

```
sudo su odoo
git clone https://github.com/odoo/odoo.git /home/odoo/odoo-12 -b 12.0 --depth=1
```

The -b option ensures that the correct branch is fetched, and the --depth=1 option ignores the modification history and fetches only the latest revision of the code, making the download more concise and faster.

> **Tip:** git is a very valuable tool when managing Odoo deployments. Note that this series of articles only scratches the surface of code version management. If you want to become more familiar with git, it is worth taking the time to learn more, starting at http://git-scm.com/doc.

At this point, we should have everything we need to install Odoo from source. You can check if it started and exited correctly with the specified user session by running the following command:

```
$ /home/odoo/odoo-12/odoo-bin --version
Odoo Server 12.0
$ exit
```

Next we will set up some system-level files and directories used in the system.

### Set up the configuration file

Adding the --save parameter when starting the Odoo service will save the configuration to the ~/.odoorc file. We will use this file as the initial file for the service configuration and save it to /etc/odoo using the following command:

```
sudo su -c "~/odoo-12/odoo-bin -d odoo-prod --db-filter='^odoo-prod$' --without-demo=all -i base --save --stop-after -init"odoo
```

This command line will also contain the configuration parameters used by the service instance.

> **Tip:** Older .openerp_serverrc configuration files are still supported and will be used if found. This can cause confusion if you have an older version of Odoo installed on the same server as Odoo 10 or later. You will find that the --save option does not update the .odoorc file, but it updates the .openerp_serverrc file.

Next we need to put the configuration file in the system's configuration file directory /etc, the command is as follows:

```
sudo mkdir /etc/odoo
sudo cp /home/odoo/.odoorc /etc/odoo/odoo.conf
sudo chown -R odoo /etc/odoo
sudo chmod u=r,g=rw,o=r /etc/odoo/odoo.conf # For security reinforcement
```

The last line in the above command is optional, but it improves the security of the system. It ensures that the user running the Odoo process can read but not modify the configuration files. At this time, you will not be able to change the database master password, but this is not a problem in production services because the web database administrator should be disabled using the list_db=False service configuration file. We also need to create a directory for the Odoo service to store log files. This is usually placed in the /var/log directory and the command is as follows:

```
sudo mkdir /var/log/odoo
sudo chown odoo /var/log/odoo
```

Now let's edit the configuration file and make sure some important parameters are configured by running the following command:

```
sudo nano /etc/odoo/odoo.conf
```

The following are recommended values ​​for the most important parameters:

```
[options]
addons_path = /home/odoo/odoo-12/odoo/addons,/home/odoo/odoo-12/addons
admin_passwd = False
db_name = odoo-prod
dbfilter = ^odoo-prod$
http_port = 8069
list_db = False
logfile = /var/log/odoo/odoo-server.log
proxy_mode = True
without_demo = all
workers = 6
```

Let's explain them one by one:

- addons_path is a comma-separated set of paths to search for addon modules. The reading order is from left to right, and the leftmost directory has the highest priority.
- admin_passwd is the master password for accessing the database management functions of the web client. Be sure to set a complex password, or better yet, set it to False to disable this function.
- db_name is the database instance that is initialized when the service starts.
- dbfilter is used to filter accessible databases. It is a regular expression interpreted by Python. To allow users to select a database without a popup window and to make unauthenticated URLs work properly, it should be set to ^dbname$, such as dbfilter=^odoo-prod$. It supports %h and %d placeholders, which are replaced by the HTTP request hostname and subdomain.
- http_port is the port number that the server listens on, the default port is 8069
- list_db = False blocks database listing at the RPC level and UI, and blocks the database management interface and corresponding RPC functions.
- logfile is the location where the service log is written. For system services, it is usually located in the /var/log folder. If left blank, the log will be printed to standard output instead.
- proxy_mode should be set to True when reverse proxy access is required. We need to use a reverse proxy.
- without_demo should be set in a production environment so that newly created databases will not have demonstration data.
- A value of workers greater than or equal to 2 enables multiprocessing, which we will discuss further shortly.

> ℹ️The http_port parameter was introduced in Odoo 10 to replace the xmlrpc_port parameter used in older versions but now deprecated.

From a security perspective, the admin_passwd=False and list_db=False options are particularly important. They block web access to database management functions and should be set in both production environments and external Odoo servers.

The following parameters are also used:

- data_dir is the path where session data and attachments are stored, remember to put the backup here
- http_interface sets the listening address. By default it listens on 0.0.0.0, but should be set to 127.0.0.1 when using a reverse proxy to respond only to local requests. It was introduced in Odoo 11 to replace the deprecated xmlrpc_interface parameter.

We can check the settings of the running service by using the -c or --config option:

```
sudo su -c "~/odoo-12/odoo-bin -c /etc/odoo/odoo.conf" odoo
```

Running Odoo with the above settings will not produce any output in the terminal, because all changes are written to the log file defined in the configuration file. To track the operation of the service, we need to run the following command in the terminal:

```
sudo tail -f /var/log/odoo/odoo-server.log
```

![Odoo 12 checks the configuration file through -c](http://alanhou.org/homepage/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/odoo-conf-test.jpg)

Sometimes you may need to output logs to standard output. The best way to do this is to copy the configuration file without the logfile option.

> **Tip:** To run multiple terminal sessions in the same terminal window, you can use an application like tmux or GNU Screen. You can use [Byobu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Byobu), which provides a nice user interface based on GNU Screen or Tmux.

### Multi-process worker process

Production instances may handle heavy workloads. By default, the service runs as a single process and can only use one core of the CPU to handle requests, because of the Python language's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). However, you can use multi-process mode to handle concurrent requests, taking advantage of multiple cores. The workers=N option sets the number of worker processes to use, and as a guide, it can be set to 1+2*P, where P is the number of cores on the processor. The optimal setting needs to be tuned on a case-by-case basis, as it depends on the server load and how many other heavy-duty services like PostgreSQL are running.

It is better to set workers higher than lower for load, the minimum value should be 6, as this is the number of parallel connections for most browsers, and the maximum value is usually limited by the server's RAM. A rule of thumb for common usage patterns is that an Odoo server should be able to handle (1+2*P)*6 concurrent users.

There are also some limit-configuration parameters that can be used to tune the worker processes. When these values ​​are reached, the worker process is recycled, the corresponding process is stopped and a new one is started. This prevents the server from running out of memory and preventing a process from overusing server resources.

The official documentation also gives some good advice on tuning worker process parameters. For more details, please refer to the official documentation [Odoo deployment](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/12.0/setup/deploy.html).

## Set up Odoo as a system service

Now we need to set Odoo as a system service and start it automatically at system boot.

In Ubuntu or Debian, the init program is responsible for starting services. Debian or its derivative operating systems used to use sysvinit, and Ubuntu used a compatible startup program called Upstart. But recently, both have been modified, and the init programs of the latest Debian and Ubuntu distributions use systemd. This means that there are now two ways to install system services, and you need to choose the correct method based on the version of the operating system. systemd should be used in Ubuntu 16.04 or later, but many cloud service providers are still using earlier versions, so it is very likely that you will also use these old versions. To check whether systemd is used in the system, use the following command:

```
 man init
```

This command will print the documentation of the currently used init program, and then you can view the startup services used.

> ℹ️The Ubuntu environment in the Windows Subsystem (WSL) is only suitable for development. It may have some abnormal problems and is completely unsuitable for running a production environment. At the time of writing this article, man init shows that the startup service is systemd, but the systemd service cannot be installed. On the contrary, it is normal when installing the sysvinit service.

Supplement: If -bash: man: command not found appears, install it through sudo apt install man -y

### Create systemd service

If you are using a more recent operating system, such as Debian 8 or Ubuntu 16.04, your startup service should be systemd. To add a service to the system, just create a file that describes the service. We create the /lib/systemd/system/odoo.service file and add the following content:

```
[Unit]
Description=Odoo
After=postgresql.service

[Service]
Type=simple
User=odoo
Group=odoo
ExecStart=/home/odoo/odoo-12/odoo-bin -c /etc/odoo/odoo.conf

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

> **Tip:** The Odoo sources contain an example odoo.service file in debian/. Instead of creating a new file, you can just copy the file and make the required changes. At least you need to modify the ExecStart options according to your setup.

Next we need to register this new service using the following command:

```
sudo systemctl enable odoo.service
```

Start the service using the following command:

```
sudo systemctl start odoo
```

Use the following command to check the service status:

```
sudo systemctl status odoo
```

![Odoo 12 service running status](http://alanhou.org/homepage/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/odoo-status.jpg)

Finally, to stop the service, use the following command:

```
sudo systemctl stop odoo
```

### Create Upstart or sysvinit service

If you are using an older operating system, such as Debian 7 or Ubuntu 15.04, then you will most likely need to use sysvinit or Upstart to start the service. Both are equivalent in terms of creating system services. Some virtual private server (VPS) services are still using old Ubuntu images, so in this case you can deploy the Odoo service in the following way.

There is an init script in the Odoo source for the Debian distribution. We only need to make some small modifications to use it to create a startup service:

```
sudo cp /home/odoo/odoo-12/debian/init /etc/init.d/odoo
sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/odoo
```

Now you may want to take a look at the contents of the init script. The main parameters are in the variables defined above the file, as shown in the following example:

```
PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
DAEMON=/usr/bin/odoo
NAME=odoo
DESC=odoo
CONFIG=/etc/odoo/odoo.conf
LOGFILE=/var/log/odoo/odoo-server.log
PIDFILE=/var/run/${NAME}.pid
USER=odoo
```

These variables should be enough for us. We will use their default values ​​for the following settings, but you can modify them according to your needs. The variable USER is the system user that runs the service. We have already created an odoo user. The variable DAEMON is the path to the executable service. The file we start Odoo in is in a different path, but we can create the following soft link:

```
sudo ln -s /home/odoo/odoo-12/odoo-bin /usr/bin/odoo
sudo chown -h odoo /usr/bin/odoo
```

The variable CONFIG is the configuration file we need to use. In the previous section, we created the configuration file under the path /etc/odoo/odoo.conf with the default configuration. Finally, the variable LOGFILE is the path where the log file is stored. The configured path /var/log/odoo was created when we defined the configuration file.

Now we should be able to start and stop the Odoo server like this:

```
$ sudo /etc/init.d/odoo start
Starting odoo: ok
```

The method of shutting down the service is similar, the command is as follows:

```
$ sudo /etc/init.d/odoo stop
Stopping odoo: ok
```

In Ubuntu, you can use the service command:

```
sudo service odoo start
sudo service odoo status
sudo service odoo stop
```

Now we need to automatically start the service when the system starts, which can be achieved through the following command:

```
sudo update-rc.d odoo defaults
```

At this point, restarting the server will automatically start the Odoo service normally. It's time to test if everything is as expected.

### Check the Odoo server using the command line

Now we can determine if the Odoo instance is running and responding to requests. If Odoo is running properly, we should get a response and no errors in the log files. To test if Odoo is responding to HTTP requests, run the following command on the server:

```
curl http://localhost:8069
<html><head><script>window.location = '/web' + location.hash;</script></head></html>
```

In addition, you can view the contents of the log file by using the following command:

```
sudo less /var/log/odoo/odoo-server.log
```

You can also use tail -f to view new content in the log file in real time:

```
sudo tail -f /var/log/odoo/odoo-server.log
```

## Set up Nginx reverse proxy

Although Odoo can output web pages by itself, it is strongly recommended to add a reverse proxy on top of it. A reverse proxy acts as an intermediary to manage the data flow between the requests sent by the client and the responses from the Odoo service. There are many benefits to using a reverse proxy.

From a safety perspective, there are the following points:

- Process and secure HTTPS protocol to encrypt data streams
- Hide internal network characteristics
- Acts as an application firewall to limit the URLs that are accepted and processed

From a performance perspective, reverse proxy can provide significant improvements:

- Cache static content, thus reducing the load on the Odoo server
- Compress content to speed up loading times
- Acts as a load balancer to distribute load among multiple services

Apache is a common choice when considering a reverse proxy, and Nginx is a hotly discussed alternative in the technology circle recently. Here we use Nginx as a reverse proxy and show how to use it to achieve the security and performance features discussed above.

First, we should install Nginx. We need it to listen to the default HTTP port, so we need to make sure it is not occupied by other services. Executing the following command should result in an error:

```
$ curl http://localhost
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 80: Connection refused
```

If you do not receive an error, you should disable the service to allow Nginx to use the port. For example, shut down the existing Apache service using sudo service apache2 stop. A better option is to remove the service from the server or reconfigure it to listen on a different port so that Nginx can use the HTTP and HTTPS ports (80 and 443) normally.

Once you have completed the above, you can install Nginx:

```
sudo apt-get install nginx -y
sudo service nginx start # If not already started, start the Nginx service
```

To confirm that Nginx is running correctly, access the server through your browser or execute curl http://localhost on the server. You should get a Welcome to nginx page.

![Nginx welcome page](http://alanhou.org/homepage/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/nginx-welcome.jpg)

Nginx configuration files are stored in /etc/nginx/available-sites/ in the same way as Apache, and can be activated by adding a soft link to /etc/nginx/enabled-sites/. Note that you should also disable the default configuration that comes with Nginx installation:

```
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
sudo touch /etc/nginx/sites-available/odoo
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/odoo /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/odoo
```

Use an editor such as nano or vi to edit the Nginx configuration file:

```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/odoo
```

A basic Nginx configuration file for an Odoo server looks like the following example:

```
upstream odoo {
    server 127.0.0.1:8069;
}
upstream odoochat {
    server 127.0.0.1:8072;
}
server {
     listen 80;
     # Add Headers for odoo proxy mode
     proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
     proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
     proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
     proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;

     # log
     access_log /var/log/nginx/odoo.access.log;
     error_log /var/log/nginx/odoo.error.log;
     # Redirect longpoll requests to odoo longpolling port
     location /longpolling {
        proxy_pass http://odoochat;
     }
     # Redirect requests to odoo backend server
     location / {
         proxy_redirect off;
         proxy_pass http://odoo;
     }
     # common gzip
    gzip_types text/css text/scss text/plain text/xml application/xml application/json application/javascript;
    gzip on;
}
```

Supplement: To add a domain name, please add the configuration of server_name in the server configuration area.

First, add upstream configuration for the Odoo service, listening on the default ports 8069 and 8072. 8069 is used for web clients and RPC requests, and 8072 is used for long polling requests required for Odoo real-time messaging in multi-process.

Nginx should receive traffic on the default HTTP port 80 and redirect it to the upstream odoo service. This is defined in the server configuration area. Traffic to the /longpolling address is passed to upstream odoochat, and the rest of the traffic is passed to upstream odoo. We also add some request header information here so that the Odoo backend service will know that this is proxied traffic.

For security reasons, you should ensure that the proxy_mode parameter is set to True. This is because when Nginx is acting as a proxy, all requests are considered to come from local rather than remote IP addresses. Setting the X-ForwardedFor header in the proxy and enabling --proxy-mode can solve this problem. However, enabling --proxy-mode without enforcing the header at the proxy level will allow others to spoof the remote address.

At the end of the configuration file, you can see two gzip-related commands, which are used to compress some files to improve performance. You can use the following command to test whether the configuration is correct:

```
$ sudo nginx -t
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```

If an error occurs, check that the configuration file is correctly entered. A common problem is that the default HTTP is used by another service, such as Apache or the default Nginx website, so before restarting the Nginx service, run the commands in this article to make sure that there is no such problem. After the process is complete, you can reload the new configuration using the following command:

```
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx reload
```

If your operating system uses systemd, the correct version of the above command should be:

```
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

Use the following command to confirm whether Nginx redirects access traffic to the background Odoo service:

```
$ curl http://localhost
<html><head><script>window.location = '/web' + location.hash;</script></head></html>
```

## Configure HTTPS security service

Website data should not be transmitted as ordinary files on the Internet. When exposing the Odoo web service to the Internet, we should use the HTTPS protocol to encrypt the data. Sometimes self-signed certificates can be used. But be aware that self-signed certificates may bring security risks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks (*Man-in-the-Middle* Attack), so some browsers will not accept the certificate.

A more robust solution is to use a certificate signed by a recognized certificate authority, which is especially important when running a commercial or e-commerce website.

> **Tip:** [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) provides free certificates. Odoo has an existing plugin module to handle automatic requests for SSL certificates for Odoo services, but at the time of writing this article, it has not yet been ported to Odoo 12. You can visit [GitHub](https://github.com/OCA/server-tools/tree/11.0/letsencrypt) for more information.

### Create a self-signed SSL certificate

Next, we should install a certificate to enable SSL. To create a self-signed certificate, use the following command:

```
$ sudo mkdir /etc/ssl/nginx && cd /etc/ssl/nginx
$ sudo openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 365 -nodes
$ sudo chmod a-wx * # make files read only
$ sudo chown www-data:root * # access only to www-data group
```

The above command creates a /etc/ssl/nginx directory and a self-signed SSL certificate without a password. When running the openssl command, the user will be asked to enter additional information, and then a certificate and key file will be generated. Finally, the ownership of these files is given to the www-data user used to run the web server.

### Configure HTTPS access on Nginx

Now that we have an SSL certificate, we can configure Nginx to use it. To force the use of HTTPS, we need to redirect all HTTP access to HTTPS. Replace the previous server area with the following:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    rewrite ^(.*) https://$host$1 permanent;
}
```

Now, if you reload the Nginx configuration and access the service in a browser, you will see that the http:// address has been converted to an https:// address. However, this address will not return any content. We need to configure the HTTPS service correctly, which can be achieved by adding the following server configuration:

```
server {
    listen 443;
    # Add Headers for odoo proxy mode
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;

    # SSL parameters
    ssl on;
    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/nginx/server.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/nginx/server.key;
    ssl_session_timeout 30m;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
    ssl_ciphers 'ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCMSHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSAAES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE- DSS-AES128-GCM-SHA256:kEDH+AESGCM:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-

```

The above configuration code will listen to the HTTPS port and use the /etc/ssl/nginx/ certificate file to encrypt data. This is similar to the server configuration area we saw in [Setting up Nginx reverse proxy](#proxy). If we reload the configuration, our Odoo service will operate over HTTPS, as shown in the following command:

```
$ sudo nginx -t
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
$ sudo service nginx reload # or: sudo systemctl reload nginx
* Reloading nginx configuration nginx
...done.
$ curl -k https://localhost
<html><head><script>window.location = '/web' + location.hash;</script></head></html>
```

The last part of the input can be used to confirm that the Odoo client is being accessed via HTTPS.

> **Tip:** In earlier Odoo images, PosBox only worked in HTTP mode, which required adding an exception for /pos/ links in Nginx. Odoo 10 and later images include a self-signed certificate to allow PosBOx and IoT Box to communicate via HTTPS, which was introduced in [GitHub](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/27936).

### Caching static content

We can configure Nginx to cache server-side static files so that when we request them again, we can access the cache in Nginx without passing the request to the upstream Odoo service. Enabling static content caching can bring faster response times and reduce the workload of the Odoo service. To enable this setting, add the following code before the location /longpolling area:

```
     # cache static data
         location ~* /web/static/ {
         proxy_cache_valid 200 60m;
         proxy_buffering on;
         expires 864000;
         proxy_pass http://odoo;
     }
```

With these commands, static data can be cached for 60 minutes. During this period, Nginx will directly respond to other requests using the cache.

## Service and module updates

Once an Odoo service has been running for a while, it may be necessary to upgrade it. This involves two steps: obtaining a new version of a service or module, and performing the installation.

### Create a staged environment

If you followed the [Installing Odoo from source](#source) section correctly, you should be able to get and test new versions of the source code in the staging repository. It is strongly recommended to create a copy of the production database and use it for upgrade testing. If odoo-prod is our production database, we can create a copy odoo-stage with the following command:

```
dropdb odoo-stage
createdb --owner=odoo odoo-stage
pg_dump odoo-prod | psql -d odoo-stage
sudo su odoo
cd ~/.local/share/Odoo/filestore/
cp -al odoo-prod odoo-stage # create filestore hardlinks
exit
```

Before using the above database copy, you should clean up, such as stopping scheduled actions and shutting down email services (including sending and receiving messages). Performing these specific steps depends on your setup, but it is usually possible to use an automated script to perform them. Remember that psql can be used to execute SQL commands directly from the command line, such as psql -d odoo-stage -c "<SQL command>".

> **Tip:** You can create a copy faster by using the createdb command: createdb --owner=odoo --template=odoo-prod odoo-stage. However, it should be noted that to run this command, there must not be any connection to the odoo-prod database, so the Odoo production environment service needs to be stopped.

### Update Odoo source code

We use the git pull command to get the latest Odoo source code from the GitHub repository. Before that, we can use the git tag command to create a tag for the current commit, so that we can easily undo the update, the command is as follows:

```
sudo su odoo
cd ~/odoo-12
git tag --force 12-last-prod
git pull
```

To make the code changes take effect, we need to restart the Odoo service. To make the changes to the data files take effect, the module needs to be upgraded. Usually, the changes to the stable version of Odoo are code fixes, so there is no need to risk performing module upgrades. If you need to upgrade a module, you can use the -u <module> additional parameter, or -u base, which will upgrade all modules.

Now you can start the Odoo staging server, which will use the upgrade code on the staging database:

```
~/odoo-12/odoo-bin -d odoo-stage --http-port=8080 -c /etc/odoo/odoo.conf # optionally add: -u base
exit
```

The Odoo staging service is configured on port 8080. You can access http://xxx:8080 through your browser to check whether the upgrade code is working correctly. If an error occurs, you can return to the previous version with the following command:

```
sudo su odoo
cd ~/odoo-12
git checkout 12-last-prod
exit
```

If everything works as expected, it is safe to perform an upgrade of the production service, usually by restarting it. If you want to perform an actual module upgrade, the recommended approach is to stop the service, run the upgrade, and restart the service, using the following command:

```
sudo service odoo stop
sudo su -c "~/odoo-12/odoo-bin -c /etc/odoo/odoo.conf -u base --stop-after-init" odoo
sudo service odoo start
```

Remember to record the Git version in use, and you can use git checkout to go back to the previous version before the modification, which allows us to roll back when necessary. It is highly recommended to save a backup before performing a database upgrade. After completion, you can use Git to pull the new version to the production warehouse and complete the upgrade:

```
sudo su odoo
cd ~/odoo-12
git tag --force 12-last-prod
git pull
exit
sudo service odoo restart # or: sudo systemctl restart odoo
```

Upgrading doesn't need to be frequent, but it's not recommended to wait a year to upgrade. Upgrade every few months. Also remember to restart the service to enable code upgrades, but not for module upgrades. But if you need to make specific bug fixes, you can upgrade earlier. You should also pay attention to public disclosures of Odoo security vulnerabilities, post to Odoo Issues on GitHub, see the [Security label](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3ASecurity), or the official mailing list, which can be subscribed at https://www.odoo.com/groups.

As a service, Enterprise Edition users will receive email notifications earlier to alert them to such issues.

## Summarize

In this article, we learned the additional steps required to set up and run Odoo on a Debian production server. We looked at the most important settings in the configuration file and learned how to make good use of multi-process mode. We also learned how to use Nginx as a reverse proxy on top of the Odoo server for improved security and scalability.

This article covers the basics of running an Odoo server and providing stable, secure services to your users. To learn more about Odoo, refer to the [official documentation](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/12.0/). It covers some topics in more depth and includes some topics not covered in this series of articles.

There are also some published books about Odoo that can help you learn. Packt Publishing has some books on this topic, specifically the Odoo Development Cookbook that covers advanced topics not covered in this series of articles.

Finally, Odoo is an open source product with an active community. Participating, asking questions, and giving back to the community not only helps with learning, but also helps with building connections. Speaking of which, we cannot fail to mention the Odoo Community Alliance (OCA), which advocates collaboration and provides high-quality open source code. You can visit https://odoo-community.org/ to learn more.
