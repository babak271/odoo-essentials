# Chapter 13 Odoo 12 Development: Creating Website Front-end Functions

This article is the thirteenth in the series of [The best free ERP system Odoo 12 development manual](README.md).

Odoo was originally a backend system, but soon there was a need for a frontend interface. The early portal interface based on the backend interface was not flexible enough and not mobile-friendly. To solve this problem, Odoo introduced a new website function and added a CMS (Content Management System) content management system to the system. This allows us to create a beautiful and efficient frontend without integrating a third-party CMS. In this article, we will learn how to use Odoo's built-in website function to develop a plug-in module for the frontend.

The main contents of this article are:

- Learning Projects - Self-help Library
- First web page
- Create a website



## Development Preparation

I will use the library_checkout plugin module that was last edited in Chapter 11 [Odoo 12 Development of Kanban View and User-side QWeb](11.md), and the code can be found in [GitHub Repository](source-code/chapter11). The completed code of this article can also be found in [GitHub Repository](source-code/chapter13).

## Learning Projects - Self-help Library

In this article, we will add a self-service feature for library members. Members can log in to their accounts to access their borrowing request list. In this way, we can learn the basic techniques of website development: creating dynamic pages, passing parameters between pages, creating forms, and handling form data validation. For these new library website features, we will create a new plugin module library_website.

Everyone should be familiar with it. First, create the plugin declaration file ibrary_website/__manifest__.py. The code is as follows:

```
{
    'name': 'Library Website',
    'description': 'Create and check book checkout requests.',
    'author': 'Alan Hou',
    'depends': [
        'library_checkout'
    ],
    'data': [
        'security/ir.model.access.csv',
        'security/library_security.xml',
        'views/library_member.xml',
    ],
}
```

The website functionality will depend on library_checkout. We have not added a dependency on the website core plugin module. The website plugin provides a useful framework for creating a fully functional website, but for now we are only exploring the basic website functionality that comes with the core framework, without using website. We want library members to access their borrowing requests on the library website with their login information. To do this, we need to add a user_id field to the library member model, which needs to be added in the model and view respectively. Let's start creating the website:

1. Add the library_website/models/library_member.py file

```
from odoo import fields, models

class Member(models.Model):
    _inherit = 'library.member'
    user_id = fields.Many2one('res.users')
```

2. Add the library_website/models/__init__.py file:

```
from . import library_member
```

3. Add the library_website/__init__.py file:

```
from . import models
```

4. Add the library_website/views/library_member.xml file:

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<odoo>
    <record id="view_form_member" model="ir.ui.view">
        <field name="name">Member Form</field>
        <field name="model">library.member</field>
        <field name="inherit_id" ref="library_member.view_form_member" />
        <field name="arch" type="xml">
            <field name="card_number" position="after">
                <field name="user_id" />
            </field>
        </field>
    </record>
</odoo>
```

Those who access these pages are portal users, and do not need to access the backend menu. We need to set security access permissions for this user group, otherwise permission errors will be reported when using the book website functions.

5. Add the library_website/security/ir.model.access.csv file to add read permissions for the book model:

```
id,name,model_id:id,group_id:id,perm_read,perm_write,perm_create,perm_unlink
access_book_portal,Book Portal Access,library_app.model_library_book,base.group_
portal,1,0,0,0
access_member_portal,Member Portal Access,library_member.model_library_member,ba
se.group_portal,1,0,0,0
access_checkout_portal,Checkout Portal Access,library_checkout.model_library_che
ckout,base.group_portal,1,0,0,0
```

6. Add record rules in the library_website/security/library_security.xml file to limit the records that portal users can access:

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<odoo>
    <data noupdate="1">
        <record id="member_portal_rule" model="ir.rule">
            <field name="name">Library Member Portal Access</field>
            <field name="model_id" ref="library_member.model_library_member" />
            <field name="domain_force">
                [('user_id', '=', user.id)]
            </field>
            <field name="groups" eval="[(4,ref('base.group_portal'))]" />
        </record>

        <record id="checkout_portal_rule" model="ir.rule">
            <field name="name">Library Checkout Portal Access</field>
            <field name="model_id" ref="library_checkout.model_library_checkout" />
            <field name="domain_force">
                [('member_id.user_id', '=', user.id)]
            </field>
            <field name="groups" eval="[(4,ref('base.group_portal'))]" />
        </record>
    </data>
</odoo>
```

base.group_portal is the identifier of the portal user group. When creating portal users, their user type should be set to Portal, not Internal User. This will make them belong to the portal user group and inherit the access rights we defined above:

![Odoo 12 Portal User Type](http://alanhou.org/homepage/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/user-type-portal.jpg)

Supplement: The above content needs to be turned on developer mode to be visible

Once a portal user has been created for a library member, it should be used in the user field on our membership form. This login will provide access to the corresponding member's borrowing requests.

> **Tip:** Using ACL and record rules in the model to implement security permissions is more secure than using controller logic. This is because an attacker may skip the web controller and directly use RPC to access the model API.

With this in mind, we can start implementing the functionality of our book website, but first let's briefly introduce basic website concepts using a simple Hello World web page.

## First web page

To begin learning the basics of Odoo web development, we will first implement a Hello World web page to demonstrate basic concepts and techniques. Pretty fancy, isn't it?

To create our first web page, we need a controller object. First, add the controllers/hello.py file:

1. Add the following line to the library_website/__init__.py file:

```
from . import controllers
```

2. Add the following line to the library_website/controllers/__init__.py file:

```
from . import hello
```

3. Add the actual controller file library_website/controllers/hello.py, the code is as follows:

```
from odoo import http

class Hello(http.Controller):
    @http.route('/helloworld', auth="public")
    def helloworld(self):
        return('<h1>Hello World!</h1>')
```

The odoo.http module provides Odoo web page related functionality. The controller we use to render the page should be an object that extends the odoo.http.Controller class. The actual name used is not too important, here we choose Hello(), a common choice is Main().

In the controller class, methods are used to match URL routes. These routes are used to do some processing and return a result, usually an HTML page to the user's web browser. The odoo.http.route decorator is used to bind methods to URL routes, in this case the /helloworld route is used.

After installing the library_website module (~/odoo-dev/odoo/odoo-bin -d dev12 -i library_website), you can open http://xxx:8069/helloworld in the browser and we should be able to see the Hello World greeting.

The processing performed by the method in this example is very simple; it returns a text string with HTML tags, Hello World.

> ℹ️Using the simple URL here to access the controller will fail if the target database is not specified if there are multiple databases for the same Odoo instance. This can be solved by setting -d or --db-filter in the startup configuration, see Chapter 2 [Development Environment Preparation for Odoo 12 Development](2.md).

You may have noticed the use of the auth='public' parameter in the route decoration, which is required for pages that are open to users who do not need to be logged in. If you remove this parameter, only logged-in users can browse this page. If there is no active session, you will be redirected to the login page.

> **Tip:** The auth='public' parameter actually means that if the visitor is not logged in, the web controller will be run as the public special user. If logged in, the logged in user will be used instead of public.

![Odoo 12 Hello World](http://alanhou.org/homepage/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/hello-world.jpg)

### Hello World using QWeb template

Creating HTML using Python strings can quickly become boring. QWeb can be used to add some color, so let's use templates to write an improved version of the Hello World web page. QWeb templates are added via XML data files, and technically they are a type of view similar to form and list views. They are even stored in the same technical model, ir.ui.view.

As usual, you need to add a declaration in the manifest file to load the file. Edit the library_website/__manifest__.py file and add the following content:

```
'data': [
...
  'views/helloworld_template.xml',
],
```

Then add the actual data file views/helloworld_template.xml with the following content:

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<odoo>
    <template id="helloworld" name="Hello World Template">
        <h1>Hello again World!</h1>
    </template>
</odoo>
```

<template> is actually a shorthand form, which declares <record> to load data into the ir.ui.view model with type="qweb". Now, we need to modify the controller method to use this template:

```
from odoo import http
from odoo.http import request

class Hello(http.Controller):

    @http.route('/helloworld', auth="public")
    def helloworld(self, **kwargs):
        return request.render('library_website.helloworld')
```

Template rendering is achieved through the request object of the render() function.

> **Tip:** Notice that we added the **kwargs method parameter. Using this parameter, any additional parameters in the HTTP request, such as GET or POST request parameters, can be captured through the kwargs dictionary. This makes our method more robust because it will not generate errors even if unexpected parameters are added.

![Hello World in Odoo 12 using QWeb template](http://alanhou.org/homepage/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/web-qweb-template.jpg)

### HelloCMS!

Let's spice things up a bit and create our own simple CMS. We can do this by using a template name (a page) in the route via the URL and then rendering it. We can then dynamically create web pages and serve them through our CMS. The implementation is simple:

```
@http.route('/hellocms/<page>', auth='public')
def hello(self, page, **kwargs):
    return http.request.render(page)
```

The page parameter above should match the external ID of a template. If you open http://xxx:8069/hellocms/library_website.helloworld in your browser, you should see the familiar Hello World page again. In fact, the built-in website module provides CMS functionality and also contains a more robust implementation under the /page path (endpoint).

![Odoo 12 CMS Example](http://alanhou.org/homepage/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/hellocms.jpg)

> ℹ️In werkzeug lingo, an endpoint is an alias for a route, represented by its static part (without placeholders). For example, the endpoint in the CMS example is /hellocms.

Most of the time, we will want to integrate our pages into an Odoo website, so the following examples will use the website plugin module.

## Create a website

The previous example is not integrated into an Odoo website and has a page footer and a website menu. The Odoo website plugin template provides these features for your convenience.

To use the website feature, we need to install the website plugin module in the working instance. This dependency should be added to the library_website plugin module, and the depends content of __manifest__.py should be modified as follows:

```
'depends': [
    'library_checkout',
    'website',
],
```

To use the website functionality, we need to make some modifications to the controller and QWeb template. In the controller, we can add an additional website=True parameter to the route:

```
@http.route('/helloworld', auth="public", website=True)
def helloworld(self, **kwargs):
    return request.render('library_website.helloworld')
```

The website=True parameter is not strictly required to integrate the website module, and it is possible to add website layouts in template views without adding it. However, adding it allows us to use some functions in the web controller:

- Routing will automatically become multilingual and will automatically detect the closest language from the languages ​​installed on the site. Please note that this may cause rerouting and redirects.
- Any exceptions thrown by the controller will be handled by the website code, which will turn the default error code into a more friendly error page for visitors.
- The request.website variable with the current website browsing history, which can be used in the request.
- The public user for the auth=public route will be the user selected in the backend website configuration. This may be related to the local region, time zone, etc.

If you don't need to use the above functions in the web controller, you can omit the website=True parameter. However, most website QWeb templates require website=True to enable some data, such as company information at the bottom, so it is best to add it.

> ℹ️The website data passed into the QWeb runtime context language is set by the _prepare_qcontext method in the website/model/ir_ui_view.py file.

To add the basic layout of a website to your template, wrap QWeb/HTML with a t-call="website.layout" directive, like this:

```
<template id="helloworld" name="Hello World Template">
    <t t-call="website.layout">
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </t>
</template>
```

t-call runs the QWeb template website.layout and passes it the tcall node in XML. website.layout is designed to render a complete web page with a menu, header, and footer, and places the passed content in the corresponding main area. In this way, our Hello World! example content will be displayed in the Odoo website page.

![Hello World after Odoo 12 relies on website](http://alanhou.org/homepage/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/website-hello-world.jpg)

### Add CSS and JavaScript resources

Our website pages may need some other CSS or JavaScript resources. These pages are managed by website, so there needs to be a way to tell it to use these files. We will use CSS to add a simple strikethrough effect, create library_website/static/src/css/library.css file and add the following content:

```
.text-strikeout {
    text-decoration: line-through;
}
```

Next, you need to include this file in your website page. You can do this by adding it to the website.assets_frontend template, which is used to load website-related assets. Add the library_website/views/website_assets.xml data file to inherit from this template:

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<odoo>
    <template id="assets_frontend"
        name="library_website_assets"
        inherit_id="website.assets_frontend">
        <xpath expr="." position="inside">
            <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
                href="/library_website/static/src/css/library.css" />
        </xpath>
    </template>
</odoo>
```

We will use the new text-strikeout class shortly. Of course, you can use a similar approach to add JavaScript resources.

### Borrowing List Controller

Now that we've gone over the basics, let's implement the borrowing list. We need to use the /checkout URL to display the borrowing list web page. To do this we need a controller method to prepare the data to be displayed, and a QWeb template to display it to the user.

Add the library_website/controllers/main.py file to the module with the following code:

```
from odoo import http
from odoo.http import request

class Main(http.Controller):
    @http.route('/checkouts', auth='user', website=True)
    def checkouts(self, **kwargs):
        Checkout = request.env['library.checkout']
        checkouts = Checkout.search([])
        return request.render(
            'library_website.index',
            {'docs': checkouts})
```

The controller gets the data to use and passes it to the rendered template. In this case the controller requires a logged in session because the route has an auth='user' attribute. This is the default behavior, it is recommended to explicitly specify that a user session is required. The logged in user is stored in the environment object and is available via request.env. The search() statement uses this to filter out the appropriate borrow records.

For controllers that can be accessed without logging in, the data that can be read is also very limited. In this case, we often need to run some code in an elevated context. In this case, we can use the sudo() model method, which modifies the permission context permissions to the internal super user, breaking most of the restrictions. With great power comes great responsibility, and we must be careful of the security risks brought by this operation. Special attention should be paid to the parameters entered when escalating permissions and the validity of the operations performed. It is recommended to control the sudo() record set operation to a minimum.

Back to our code, it ends with the request.render() method. As before, we pass in the identifier of the QWeb template to render, and the context dictionary used by the template to run. In this case, we pass the docs variable to the template, which contains the set of records to render the loan records.

### Borrowing QWeb template

QWeb templates use data files to add. We can use the library_website/views/checkout_template.xml file and add the following code:

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<odoo>
    <template id="index" name="Checkout List">
        <t t-call="website.layout">
            <div id="wrap" class="container">
                <h1>Checkouts</h1>

                <!-- List of Checkouts -->
                <t t-foreach="docs" t-as="doc">
                    <div class="row">
                        <input type="checkbox" disabled="True"
                            t-att-checked="'checked' if doc.stage_id.fold else None" />
                        <a t-attf-href="/checkout/{{slug(doc)}}">
                            <h3 t-field="doc.request_date"
                                t-att-class="'text-strikeout' if doc.stage_id.fold else ''" />
                        </a>
                    </div>
                </t>
            </div>
        </t>
    </template>
</odoo>
```

The code above uses the t-foreach directive to iterate over the docs recordset. We use a checkbox input and keep it checked when the borrow is complete. In HTML, whether a checkbox is checked depends on whether it has a checked attribute. For this reason, we use the t-att-NAME specification to dynamically render the checked attribute based on an expression. When the expression evaluates to None (or any other false value), QWeb will ignore the attribute, which is very convenient in this example.

When rendering the task name, the t-attf directive is used to dynamically create a URL that opens the detail form for each specified task. We use a special function slug() to generate an easy-to-read URL for each record. The link is not available yet because we haven't created the corresponding controller yet.

On each borrow record, we also use the t-att directive to apply text-strikeout styles when the borrow is final.

![Odoo 12 book project checkouts](http://alanhou.org/homepage/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/checkouts.jpg)

### Borrowing details page

Each item in the borrowing list has a link to the corresponding detail page. We will implement a controller for these links and a QWeb template for display. It should be very clear at this point.

Add the following method to the library_website/controllers/main.py file:

```
class Main(http.Controller):
...

    @http.route('/checkout/<model("library.checkout"):doc>',
        auth='user', # default value, but explicitly specified here
        website=True)
    def checkout(self, doc, **kwargs):
        return http.request.render(
            'library_website.checkout',
            {'doc': doc})
```

Note that the route here uses a placeholder with a model("library.checkout") converter, which is mapped to the doc variable of the method. It captures the borrow identifier from the URL, which can be a simple ID value or a link alias, and converts it into the corresponding browsing record object.

For the QWeb template, add the following code to the library_website/views/checkout_template.xml data file:

```
    <template id="checkout" name="Checkout Form">
        <t t-call="website.layout">
            <div id="wrap" class="container">
                <h1 t-field="doc.request_date" />
                <h5>Member: <span t-field="doc.member_id" /></h5>
                <h5>Stage: <span t-field="doc.stage_id" /></h5>
            </div>
        </t>
    </template>
```

It is worth mentioning the use of the <t t-field> element. As in the backend, it handles the appropriate display of the field value. For example, it correctly displays date values ​​and many-to-one values.

## Summarize

The reader should now have a good grasp of the basics of website functionality. We learned how to use the web controller and QWeb templates to dynamically render web pages. Then we learned how to use the website plugin and use it to create our own pages. Finally, we introduced the website form plugin to help us create web forms. These are the core skills for creating website functionality.

Now that we have learned about the development of the main components of Odoo, it is time to learn how to deploy Odoo services to a production environment.
